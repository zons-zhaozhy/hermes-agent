    Uses SQLite's backup() API to write snapshot pages into the live

    any other process still holding the DB open (gateway, dashboard,
    another CLI session) sees the restored data on the next read —
    instead of continuing to serve stale cached pages from a replaced
    inode.

    The old approach was ``unlink() + move()``, which replaced the file
    under any live connection.  SQLite connections cache pages in
    per-connection page caches keyed by inode; after an unlink+move the
    old inode still existed (the live connection held a reference), so
    that connection continued serving the pre-restore data while new
    connections saw the restored snapshot — a partial/inconsistent
    state (issue #65942).

    By writing pages through the backup API the file inode is preserved,
    the WAL journal is updated correctly, and all connections (old and
    new) converge on the restored data.

    Falls back to the unlink+move approach on failure ONLY when no other
    process or in-process connection holds the file: replacing the inode
    under a live holder is the #90950 split-brain, so that branch fails
    closed (returns ``False``) and the caller reports the file as skipped.

    crash between the truncate and the write therefore leaves that file empty
    with nothing behind it — during ``hermes import``, which is the
    disaster-recovery path a user reaches for *because* they already lost
    something.  Staging into the target's own directory and publishing with a
    rename means the target only ever moves from its old contents to the
    complete new contents.

    ``atomic_replace`` rather than a bare ``os.replace``: it resolves a
    symlinked target first, so a deployment that links ``config.yaml`` into a
    dotfiles repo keeps the link instead of having it silently swapped for a
    regular file (GitHub #16743), and it falls back to copy/fsync/unlink on
    ``EXDEV``/``EBUSY`` for cross-device and bind-mount installs.  That
    fallback uses ``shutil.copyfile``, which does truncate in place, so on the
    cross-device path the guarantee above degrades to today's behaviour rather
    than improving on it; closing that belongs in ``utils.atomic_replace``,
    where every atomic writer in the repo would benefit, not here.

    Permission bits *and* ownership are carried across the replace so routing
    through mkstemp does not change the file the caller would otherwise have
    produced.  ``os.replace`` swaps in a temp file owned by the *writing* user,
    so without the chown a ``sudo hermes import`` would silently re-own every
    restored file to root — on the disaster-recovery path, and on exactly the
    Docker/NAS installs ``utils._restore_file_owner`` documents.  Both concerns
    delegate to the shared ``utils`` helpers rather than being re-derived here.
    The temp file is removed on any failure so a partial import leaves no
    residue.

    The one bit of the old file *not* carried across is setuid/setgid.  The
    replacement bytes come out of the zip, so preserving those would let an
    archive take over the identity an existing privileged file executes as —
    and unlike the other ``utils`` writers, which re-serialize content this
    process produced, the trust boundary here is an untrusted archive.  The
