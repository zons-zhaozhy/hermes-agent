"""Move a user from a memory provider that left core onto its catalog plugin.

A bundled ``plugins/memory/<name>`` that becomes a standalone catalog plugin keeps the same provider
name, the settings it already read, its data directory and tool names, so the migration is only
"the code now lives under ``HERMES_HOME/plugins/<name>``". Two hooks call :func:`migrate_home`:

* ``hermes update`` — for every profile home that shares the venv (primary; runs where the venv was
  just rebuilt anyway).
* agent init — when the configured provider cannot be found at all, once per process (Desktop
  users update through the app and never run ``hermes update`` by hand).

Both install the catalog entry at its reviewed pin through the normal plugin install path (kill
list, dependency constraints, enable), never a custom source. Every outcome — installed, refused,
failed, absent from the catalog — reaches the user (terminal, Desktop, chat platform), never only
``agent.log``: a provider that silently stays missing is lost memory.
