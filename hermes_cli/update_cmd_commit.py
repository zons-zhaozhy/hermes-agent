"""The single commit point of a source ``hermes update``: everything the tree move needs armed first.

Before git (or the ZIP swap) writes the first file of the new code, three things are durable:

* the interrupted-pull marker (``.git/hermes-update-pull``) naming the commit git moves to, for EVERY
  tree move (branch switch, upstream fork pull, the pull itself) so a launch after any exit that left
  a torn tree puts the old one back (``_early_recovery.restore_interrupted_pull``);
* the source-completion tail (``venv_sync.arm_completion``) and the host fleet-restart obligation,
  so a kill after the move but before the completion child starts still leaves the tail owed to the
  next launch (``venv_sync.prepare_launch``) and the restart owed to the next ``hermes update``.

Failures before the move are no-ops: ``disarm_commit_obligations`` puts both obligations back the way
this run found them once the tree is verified at its pre-update commit again.
