"""Steward classification and refusal text for sealed install trees.

Adapted from the restack branch's ``installation/tree.py``. Our branch has
no ``installation`` package yet — detection here is rewritten onto the two
facts this branch already ships:

* ``.git`` at the project root says the tree is a checkout the uninstaller
  / updater may mutate.
* The build stamp (``install-stamp.json``, written by
  ``scripts/write_install_stamp.py``) names the steward in
  ``distribution`` (``desktop-app``, ``docker``, ``nix``, or a future
  package manager) for sealed trees.

A sealed tree (no ``.git``) belongs to a steward: only the steward removes
or replaces its code. The refusal messages below always leave the user a
working next step for their data (``hermes uninstall --data`` / the
desktop app's Settings -> About page).
