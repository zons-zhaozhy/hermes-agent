"""Call-site API for process-level shared-metrics facts.

Setup completion, slash commands, compression, model switches, fallbacks and extension installs
happen outside any single tool or model call, so their producers call these functions directly.
Every function takes RAW values (normalization lives in shared_metrics_fields), is a no-op unless
shared metrics are enabled, and never raises into the caller.
