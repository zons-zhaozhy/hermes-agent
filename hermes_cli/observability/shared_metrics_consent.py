"""The one shared-metrics consent answer, and the terminal's first-run offer.

Every surface reads and writes the same two keys in the profile's config.yaml:
``telemetry.shared_metrics.enabled`` (collect locally) and ``.send`` (upload daily). The question
counts as answered once either key is written explicitly; the shipped defaults are not an answer.
Desktop paints the offer as a composer strip (``consent-strip.tsx`` over the ``shared_metrics.*``
RPCs). The terminal asks at the end of every ``hermes setup`` flow and, for a profile that never
answered, once before an interactive ``hermes`` / ``hermes --tui`` chat (which also covers the
dashboard's Chat tab, a PTY-hosted TUI). The messaging gateway never asks: a chat participant is
not the install owner.
