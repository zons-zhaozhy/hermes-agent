"""Call-site API for messaging-gateway and cron shared metrics.

Platform connection health, outbound delivery outcomes, first-reply latency and cron runs happen on
the gateway event loop, adapter tasks or the cron ticker, never inside a model or tool call. Every
recorder takes RAW runtime objects, derives only closed classes / buckets / public platform names,
and hands the recording to one background worker so the caller's loop never waits on the first
runtime build or a config read. The worker runs in a copy of the caller's context, so the profile
the caller was scoped to (gateway multiplex, cron ``_profile_cron_scope``) owns the row.

This module is imported by ``gateway/platforms/base.py`` at class-definition time: keep imports lazy.
