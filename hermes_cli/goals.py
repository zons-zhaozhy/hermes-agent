"""Persistent session goals — the Ralph loop for Hermes.

A goal is a free-form objective that stays active across turns; after each turn an auxiliary-model
judge decides whether it is satisfied. The continuation prompt is a normal user message appended via
``run_conversation`` (no system-prompt mutation or toolset swap — prompt caching stays intact). Judge
failures are fail-OPEN (``continue``); the turn budget is the backstop.

    Returns ``(verdict, reason, parse_failed, wait_directive, transport_failed)`` where verdict
    is ``"done"``, ``"continue"``, ``"wait"``, or ``"skipped"`` (when the
    judge couldn't be reached). ``wait_directive`` is set only for ``"wait"``
    (``{"pid": int}`` or ``{"seconds": int}``); ``None`` otherwise.

    ``parse_failed`` is True only when the judge call succeeded but its output
    was unusable (empty or non-JSON). API/transport errors return False — they
    are transient and should fail-open silently.

    ``transport_failed`` is True only when the judge couldn't reach the API at
    all (auth 401, timeout, DNS, connection error).  Repeated transport
    failures signal a permanent config problem (e.g. invalid API key). Callers
    use this flag to auto-pause after N consecutive transport failures (see
    ``DEFAULT_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_TRANSPORT_FAILURES``). Callers use this flag to
    auto-pause after N consecutive parse failures (see
    ``DEFAULT_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_PARSE_FAILURES``).

    ``subgoals`` is an optional list of user-added criteria (from
    ``/subgoal``) factored into the verdict. ``background_processes`` is the
    live ``process_registry.list_sessions()`` snapshot; when the agent is
    waiting on one (a CI poller, build, etc.) the judge can return a ``wait``
    verdict naming its pid, parking the loop instead of re-poking.
    ``contract`` is an optional structured completion contract; when present
    the judge decides DONE strictly against its Verification criterion and
    refuses completion when a Constraint was violated.
    ``tool_calls_summary`` is a brief description of the tool calls the agent
    made this turn (e.g. "3 calls: terminal, read_file, terminal"); when
    provided, the judge can detect claims without supporting tool execution.
    All four are additive — a contract, subgoals, a background-process list,
    and a tool-calls summary can coexist in one judge prompt; when none are
    set, behavior is identical to the original free-form judge.

    This is deliberately fail-open: transport errors return ``("continue", ..., ..., None, True)``
    — the ``transport_failed=True`` flag lets callers track and auto-pause after
    N consecutive transport failures (see
    ``DEFAULT_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_TRANSPORT_FAILURES``) so a permanently broken
    judge doesn't burn the entire turn budget.
