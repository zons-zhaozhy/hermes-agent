"""Checkout custody for the updater's children (R2): the ONE spawn policy for every git (and the
Node build) an update starts.

The checkout kernel lock (``update_lock``) must stay held while any process of the update tree
can still write the checkout, and must NOT leak into processes that outlive the update:

* Every updater git call carries ``-c gc.autoDetach=false -c maintenance.auto=false``: git never
  forks a detached gc/maintenance child that would inherit (POSIX) or outlive (Windows) the lock.
* POSIX: the lock fd is inherited ONLY by git commands that mutate the worktree, index or refs
  locally (:data:`LOCAL_MUTATORS`, run with ``core.fsmonitor=false`` so no fsmonitor daemon
  starts under them, with no credential helper and no repository hooks). Network/credential commands (fetch,
  ls-remote, credential) and readers run without it: a ``git credential-cache--daemon`` they
  start never holds the checkout. A partial clone's mutator would lazily fetch the objects a move
  needs as a child holding the fd (and start the daemon under it), so before a move the objects
  are fetched without the fd and with the user's helpers (:func:`_prefetch_for_move`); a lazy
  fetch the prefetch missed still runs, just without a helper. A killed fetch that leaves
  ``*.lock`` ref files is recovered by the stale-lock rules (``gitlock.clear_stale_git_locks``).
* Windows has no fd inheritance: while this process holds (or joined) the checkout lock, every
  child started here is created SUSPENDED, assigned to the update's kill-on-close job and only
  then resumed, so it and everything it spawns die with the lock owner. The Node build goes
  through ``pm.progress.run_contained`` (whose Popen it never sees): :func:`contained_command`
  wraps it in a stdlib launcher that joins the job before it starts node and, once node exits,
  terminates and waits out everything node left running (C3): a normal release never frees the
  checkout under a build descendant.
* Windows fails CLOSED (D2): a child the job refuses is never run. The msvcrt byte lock belongs
  to the process that took it — an inherited handle does not keep it, the kernel unlocks it when
  the owner exits — so nothing else could fence a writer outside the job: after the owner's
  death the lock would be free while it still wrote. A refused bind kills the still-suspended
  child; a refused launcher join exits before it starts node; either raises
  :class:`CustodyRefused`, a clear refusal of that step instead of an unfenced writer.

Every updater git runner (``update_cmd._git_run``, ``update_cmd_git._git_run``,
``update_cmd_stash``, ``update_cmd_check``, ``gitlock``, ``update_cmd_commit``,
``_early_recovery``'s restore) calls :func:`run_git`.
Not covered, on purpose: the read-only release/check readers (``source_releases``,
``source_check``: ``ls-remote``, ``cherry``, ``rev-parse``) run their own probes; they never get
the lock fd and write nothing, so they cannot leak or outlive custody of the checkout.

# A stdlib launcher for children whose Popen the updater never sees (``run_contained``): it
# joins the job named by an inherited handle, starts the real command suspended with the same
# stdio, runs it only once it is in the job, and drops that handle (only the owner's handle may
# keep the job open). A refused join, or a command outside the job, never runs (D2): the launcher says so on stderr, writes the notice to the report file
# (argv[2]) — run_contained captures the child's stderr, so stderr alone is not seen (m1) — and
# exits; the updater logs the notice, notes it in the receipt and raises CustodyRefused.
# The command also runs in a kill-on-close job of the launcher's own, nested in the update job
# (review C3): once the command exits, the launcher terminates that job — whatever npm / the
# builder started and left running — and waits until no process of it is left before it
# returns, so the caller never releases the checkout while a build descendant still writes.
# Only the command's tree: the update job also holds the update's other children. The Windows
# twin of the POSIX launcher below (_REAP_TREE); the nested job's handle closing (a killed
# launcher) kills the tree too.

# POSIX twin of the launcher (N13, review L1/L6). Node marks the donated lock fd close-on-exec,
# so nothing node starts (npm, esbuild, sh) keeps the checkout locked: custody of them rests on
# this stdlib parent, which holds the fd until no descendant of the command is left.
# * The command stays in the CALLER's process group: every group kill that stops a build (a
#   Ctrl-C'd completion child's ``killpg``, Desktop's ``kill(-pid)``) reaches node and everything
#   under it that did not start a session of its own. The custodian leaves that group (E): a
#   SIGKILL of the group would otherwise kill it too, and a descendant in a session of its own
#   would go on writing with the checkout lock free. It outlives the kill, settles the tree as
#   below, and only then exits (releasing the fd).
# * Linux: the custodian is a child subreaper, so a descendant orphaned by node's exit (or by any
#   intermediate's) is re-parented to it, never to init. Once node exits it SIGKILLs and reaps
#   its children until none is left; it only signals its own unreaped children, so no pid it
#   kills can have been reused (never a ``killpg`` of an already reaped leader's group).
# * Elsewhere (macOS has no subreaper) it records node's descendant tree from ``ps`` while node
#   runs and, once node exits, kills every recorded process whose start time still matches,
#   plus what they started. Best effort: a process born and orphaned between two samples escapes.
# * SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP are forwarded to node (a node still running 10 s later is killed); the
#   descendants are then killed as above.
# * The custodian is NOT the process the runner sees (R4): ``subprocess.run`` SIGKILLs its own
#   child when Ctrl-C reaches the caller, and no group separation survives a direct kill. The
#   runner's child only forks the custodian (own group) and relays signals to it and its exit
#   status back; it leaves the caller's group too, or a terminal's Ctrl-C would reach node twice. Killed, it leaves the custodian to settle: node gets the same 10 s it gets after
#   a forwarded signal (it is usually still cleaning up from the same Ctrl-C), then the tree is
#   killed as above and only then is the fd dropped.
