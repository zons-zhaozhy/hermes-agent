"""Quiet ``hermes chat -Q`` helpers: bind this session's key and resume nested notifies.

Bot Mode delivers a local DM as ``hermes -p <bot> chat -Q --query-file``. Interactive
chat binds ``set_current_session_key(self.session_id)`` around the turn; the quiet
path did not, so a nested ``message_agent`` notify inherited the dispatcher's
``HERMES_SESSION_KEY`` and never woke the recipient. Quiet also printed and exited
after one turn, so a nested teammate reply that finished during the one-shot linger
was never injected as a follow-up.
