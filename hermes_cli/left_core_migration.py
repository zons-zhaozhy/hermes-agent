"""Move a home onto the catalog plugin of a feature that left core.

A feature (gateway platform, toolset) that moves from core into a standalone catalog plugin keeps its
names, config keys and env vars, so migrating is only "install the plugin". Each row of
:data:`LEFT_CORE` names the catalog plugin and a read-only predicate "does this home use it". The
contract is the one memory providers established (``memory_provider_migration``, whose helpers this
reuses; memory is not a row because its plugin name comes from ``memory.provider``, not a table):

* ``hermes update`` installs the plugin for every profile home sharing the venv that uses the feature.
* Agent start and gateway start retry once per process for the active home (Desktop users update
  through the app and never run ``hermes update``), honouring ``security.allow_lazy_installs``.
* After a failed attempt (catalog miss or unreachable, failed install) starts skip the row for
  :data:`STARTUP_RETRY_SECONDS`, so an offline machine pays the network round trip once, not on every
  ``hermes chat``; ``hermes update`` always retries.
* A home gets the plugin automatically at most once (``_left_core_installed`` in its config.yaml):
  ``hermes plugins remove`` afterwards is the user's choice and sticks.

Installs go through the normal catalog install path at the reviewed pin (kill list, dependency
constraints, enable). Unattended dependency consent covers only these rows: the feature shipped in
core, so its users already accepted its dependencies. Every outcome reaches the user (terminal,
Desktop, chat); a gateway-start outcome waits for the home's first agent to deliver it.
