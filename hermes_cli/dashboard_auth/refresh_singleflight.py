"""Single-flight + short replay cache for rotating refresh tokens (both refresh paths).

Rotating refresh tokens with reuse detection (Nous Portal, Authelia, most OIDC IdPs) make a
replay of an already-rotated RT fatal: the provider revokes the whole session. The desktop and
the browser both fire bursts of parallel requests on wake or after the access token lapses,
each still carrying the same old RT, so the gateway must let exactly ONE of them reach the
provider and hand the rotated session to the rest. The cookie gate (``middleware``) and the
native bearer route (``routes.auth_native_refresh``) share this one flight table.

A provider hint only orders discovery: it must neither split one rotating credential's lock
nor let an unrelated provider reuse its result. Raw refresh tokens are never keys.
