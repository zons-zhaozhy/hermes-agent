"""Durable record of the gateways and services ``hermes update`` paused on Windows.

The pause token used to live only in the updater's memory (plus an ``atexit`` resume), so a
killed updater (console closed, ``taskkill``, power loss) left every paused gateway and SCM
service stopped with nothing on disk saying so. The record is written under the ROOT Hermes
home BEFORE anything is stopped, names its owner (pid + creation time, the update-marker
identity format), is rewritten as the token changes, and is removed only after a verified
resume. A later launch whose owner check finds the updater dead (and no update live) resumes it.

One record per checkout (the file name carries a key of the install root): a checkout sharing
the home never imports, relabels or certifies another checkout's paused set — its tree gate
says nothing about the other tree.

Resuming is gated on a whole tree: no interrupted-pull marker; at the pre-update HEAD, no tracked
change beyond the ones present at pause time (git died before moving HEAD); at a moved HEAD,
dependencies current for it where a launch syncs them (a build step may rewrite tracked files there). Every pause folded into
a record keeps its own baseline (``baselines``): each one taken at the current HEAD must hold.
Otherwise the record stays for the next launch, which runs after the interrupted-pull restore and
the dependency sync.

Custody: every mutation (write, claim, retire, discharge) happens while holding a kernel lock on
``<record dir>/.hermes-update-paused-gateways.lock`` (flock / msvcrt, released by the kernel when
the holder dies; the file is never deleted), and the read → judge → mutate decision is made
inside that hold. A recovering launch claims a record by publishing ``<record>.<pid>.<nonce>.claim``
with its own identity already inside (atomic replace), then retires the source; a crash between the
two leaves two files with ONE obligation id (``pause_id``), and an update that folds orphaned sets
into its own record lists their ids under ``absorbed`` before retiring them. Readers treat a file
whose id another file carries as a copy, never as a second obligation, and the next mutator
retires it. Completing an obligation first adds its ids to ``<record stem>.retired`` (atomic), then
unlinks its files: an unlink Windows refuses (a reader holding the file without
FILE_SHARE_DELETE) leaves a copy that is redundant by id, never an obligation that executes again.
The list is read only under the mutex, and only its absence means "nothing retired": a list that
cannot be read means unknown, so nothing is claimed and the list is never rewritten from that read.
A list that reads but does not parse is unknown too while any record or claim exists; with none
left it guards nothing and is set aside as ``<record stem>.corrupt``.
