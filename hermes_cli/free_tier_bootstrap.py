"""Serve-start bootstrap for the Nous free tier: the ONE place a free-tier identity is created.

Every Hermes process that may need the free tier runs this once at boot (``hermes serve`` on a
daemon thread beside the other background boots; the CLI first-run guard synchronously). It
inventories credentials cheap-first, creates the identity only when the launch gate is open
(:func:`hermes_cli.anon_auth.guest_enabled`), resolves which provider carries inference, records
the answer in process memory, and tells every connected client with one ``setup.ready`` event.

Nothing else mints. ``free_tier.status`` and ``setup.status`` read the record; provider resolution
never reaches the portal; a dead credential is replaced by the explicit re-mint in
``auth_nous.resolve_nous_runtime_credentials``. Ruling: NS-845 Q1.2 (recorded on NS-847).
