# TABLE with the indexes DROP TABLE takes down with it.
# ``test_rebuilt_schema_matches_fresh`` guards this against SCHEMA_SQL drift.
# The current schema uses ``INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`` / ``INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0``. ``CREATE
# TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`` skips existing tables regardless of schema and ``_add_column_if_missing`` only adds
# columns, so neither can fix a drifted column type — the table must be rebuilt. See #35096. Each entry
# pairs the canonical CREATE TABLE with the CREATE INDEX statements that DROP TABLE would otherwise take
# down with it (including ``idx_events_run``, added by the additive pass above). To guard against this list
# drifting from SCHEMA_SQL, ``test_rebuilt_schema_matches_fresh`` asserts a rebuilt legacy DB is
# byte-identical to a fresh one.
