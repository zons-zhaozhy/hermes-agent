"""Idle-exit for Desktop-owned ``hermes serve --isolated`` backends reached over SSH (#101626).

That backend is deliberately detached (``setsid``/``nohup``, PPID 1) so it survives the SSH channel
closing, and every teardown path lives on the CLIENT. A laptop that sleeps mid-session (dark wake
reconnects the tunnel, spawns a backend, sleeps again) therefore leaves a backend behind every
cycle — each one an extra writer on ``state.db``. The server needs its own liveness signal.

Two pieces, both scoped to the SSH-isolated case (a session token was handed over via
``--ssh-session-token-file``):

* An ASGI wrapper counts accepted WebSocket connections (every dashboard WS route: /api/ws,
  /api/pty, /api/console, /api/pub, /api/events, /api/audio/speak-stream) without touching the
  handlers. When the count has been zero for the grace window and no agent turn is running, the
  watchdog asks uvicorn to exit gracefully (WAL checkpoint, exit 0). An indeterminate turn probe
  fails closed: the backend stays up.
* Loopback normally disables uvicorn's WS ping (a dead local client sends FIN/RST). Across an SSH
  tunnel the local socket is healthy while the far end is asleep, so pings are the only way to notice
  a half-open tunnel; the isolated backend keeps a slow ping with a long timeout so a GIL-holding
  turn cannot trip it.

Design and the client-count/turn-probe/fail-closed shape are from #101678 by @StanleyStetson; this
is the slim redo on the decomposed web server.
