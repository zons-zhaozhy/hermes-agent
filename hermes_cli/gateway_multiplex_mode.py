"""Boot-time verdict for ``gateway.multiplex_profiles`` (the default is on, and there is no opt-out).

``GatewayConfig.from_dict`` leaves the flag ``None`` when neither config.yaml nor
``GATEWAY_MULTIPLEX_PROFILES`` set it. Turning the default on must not make a default gateway
double-bind a fleet that still runs per-profile gateways (two pollers on one bot token, port
fights), so the implicit default is a *request*: the gateway runs the same preflight
``hermes gateway migrate --multiplex`` runs and multiplexes only when the fold would have been
safe. An explicit ``true`` is never second-guessed.

An explicit ``false`` is RETIRED (multiplex-only ruling): it parses, it is logged, and it is then
resolved exactly like an unset key. The key itself survives because it is still the RUNTIME
mode flag every scoped code path reads (``config.multiplex_profiles``) — what it can no longer do
is pin a second gateway process onto this host.

The refusal is logged, never fatal: the gateway comes up standalone exactly as before the
default flipped, and the log names the blocker plus ``hermes gateway migrate --multiplex``.
