"""RelayAdapter — one generic gateway adapter fronted by the connector. EXPERIMENTAL.

A single ``BasePlatformAdapter`` subclass that, at handshake, receives a
``CapabilityDescriptor`` from the connector telling it which platform it is
fronting and which capabilities to advertise to the ``GatewayStreamConsumer``.
It implements the four abstract methods (``connect`` / ``disconnect`` / ``send``
/ ``get_chat_info``) plus the capability surface (``MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH``,
``message_len_fn``, ``supports_draft_streaming``) by delegating wire I/O to an
injected transport and reading capabilities off the descriptor.

There is NO per-platform gateway code: the connector is the only side that knows
"this chat_id maps to a Discord channel, send it via the Discord websocket."
The gateway sees an ordinary ``MessageEvent`` in and calls ``adapter.send`` out.

EXPERIMENTAL: the transport protocol and descriptor schema may change without a
deprecation cycle until >=2 Class-1 platforms validate them.

        The base class spawns ``_keep_typing`` for every adapter (a 2s refresh
        loop for the life of the turn), but the relay adapter inherited the
        base no-op ``send_typing`` — so hosted/relay chats never showed
        "is typing…" even though the wire contract (``OutboundOp "typing"``)
        and every connector-side sender (Discord ``POST /channels/{id}/typing``,
        Telegram ``sendChatAction``, Signal ``sendTyping``, Slack assistant
        status) already implement it. This bridges the loop's tick onto the
        existing outbound frame.

        Two details are load-bearing, mirroring ``send()``:
          - ``_with_scope``: the connector's egress guard wraps ALL ops
            (routedEgressGuard), so a typing frame without a resolvable tenant
            discriminator (metadata.scope_id, or user_id for DMs) is declined
            exactly like a bare send would be.
          - the per-frame ``platform`` tag (Phase 1.5): a multi-platform
            gateway must egress typing through the platform the chat lives on.

        Best-effort: failures are swallowed (``_keep_typing`` already treats
        send_typing errors as non-fatal, and an older connector that rejects
        the op just returns an unsuccessful result we ignore). Each call is
        one-shot — Discord/Telegram indicators self-expire and need no cleanup;
        Slack Assistant status persists, so ``stop_typing`` below sends an
