"""Durable delivery-obligation ledger for gateway final responses (rows in the shared ``state.db``;
WAL, owner pid + process-start liveness, bounded retention) so a crash between finalize and
platform ACK cannot lose a response silently. Checkpoints: record_obligation() 'pending' before
any send | mark_attempting() 'attempting' right before the await | mark_delivered() 'delivered'
only on SendResult.success | mark_failed() 'failed' on a definitive rejection. Crash semantics
(never silently resend an ambiguous send): pending = never started, redeliver plainly; attempting
= crashed mid-await, platform MAY have it, redeliver WITH a visible recovered marker; failed =
rejected once, restart is a retry boundary, also marked; delivered = prune. Attempts are capped
and stale rows expire, both -> 'abandoned' (kept briefly, then pruned). Everything is
best-effort: ledger failures must never block a send; callers wrap every call in try/except.
