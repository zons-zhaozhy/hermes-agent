    SO_REUSEADDR: on macOS (BSD) two wildcard/specific sockets can silently split traffic while
    both report success → disable. On Linux it only permits rebinding past TIME_WAIT (a quick
    restart would otherwise fail to bind for ~60s) → keep the default.

    The macOS exclusive bind also refuses the port while a server-side TIME_WAIT socket lingers
    (2*MSL = 30s after the previous gateway closed a connection first — its shutdown, or any
    ``Connection: close`` request), so a ``/restart`` re-binding within seconds failed with
    EADDRINUSE although nobody was listening. Preventing the TIME_WAIT at close time (SO_LINGER 0)
    would reset in-flight senders and misses the per-request case, hence the bind-side retry: for an
    explicit host, ``has_live_listener`` refused proves the address is free (the kernel still
    rejects an exact duplicate even with SO_REUSEADDR, and a foreign wildcard listener answers the
    probe), so one retry with reuse_address=True is safe. A wildcard host keeps the strict path: a
    foreign listener on a non-loopback interface could not be probed, so it must keep winning."""
