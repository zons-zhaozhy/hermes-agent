"""Shared wording for the exec-approval prompt every messaging surface renders.

The button card (``BasePlatformAdapter._format_exec_approval``) and the plain-text
``/approve`` fallback (``gateway.run._format_exec_approval_fallback``) must tell the user
the same three things: what Hermes wants to run, why it was flagged, and that silence means
the command does NOT run once ``approvals.timeout`` elapses. Keeping the text here means one
edit changes every platform; adapters only wrap these strings in their own markup.

No imports from ``gateway.platforms.base`` or ``gateway.run`` — both import this module.
