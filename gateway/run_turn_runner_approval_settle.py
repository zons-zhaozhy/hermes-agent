"""Tell the chat when an exec-approval prompt times out (messaging platforms).

``tools.approval_gateway_wait._await_gateway_decision`` calls ``entry.settle(reason)`` once the
wait ends. Only the TUI registered such a hook, so on Telegram / Slack / WhatsApp a card whose
timer ran out kept live buttons and the user never learned the command did NOT run. The turn
runner registers the hook here right after the prompt was delivered.

Best-effort by design: a failed notice is logged at debug — the approval already resolved as
"no", and nothing here may block the agent thread.
