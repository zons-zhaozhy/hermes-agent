"""Cron: teardown of a worker that outlived its ``run_job``.

``ThreadPoolExecutor.shutdown(wait=False)`` after an inactivity timeout does not stop a
worker already inside ``run_conversation``. Finalizing its SessionDB from ``run_job``'s
``finally`` would close a handle the worker is still writing to — the checkpoint/WAL-unlink
overlap behind #102827. The worker's Future owns the teardown instead.
