"""The connection operation (``manage_connections`` card): the request event that opens a card,
the update frames that drive it, and the RPCs the card answers through.

Shapes are typed from ``tools/connectors/operation.py`` (``Target.snapshot``,
``ConnectionOperation.request_payload`` / ``_snapshot_locked``) and
``tui_gateway/methods_connectors.py`` (``_operation_view``, ``_connection_update``). The card is a
projection: every frame carries the full target snapshot, and the renderer never derives state.
