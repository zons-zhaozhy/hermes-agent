"""Per-session event sequencing + bounded replay for WS reconnects.

Every event frame through :func:`server.write_json` (hence ``_emit``) gets a per-session monotonic
``seq`` and lands in a small ring per session; a reconnecting client calls ``session.events.since``
with its last seen seq and gets everything newer. Invariants: stdio TUI unaffected (``seq`` only on
event frames; Ink ignores unknown keys); one lock guards counters + buffers, and write_json already
serializes per-transport writes so stamping cannot reorder frames; memory bound =
_REPLAY_BUFFER_MAX events AND _REPLAY_BUFFER_BYTES_MAX frozen UTF-8 payload bytes per session,
_REPLAY_PROCESS_BYTES_MAX frozen UTF-8 payload bytes across at most _REPLAY_SESSIONS_MAX sessions,
oldest evicted FIFO (their seq/truncation counters are retained so a revisited session stays
monotonic within the epoch, #100122). Evicted or never-retained (oversized) frames leave a truncation watermark so a
reconnecting client refetches instead of trusting a replay with holes.
