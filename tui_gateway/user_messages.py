"""User-facing copy for gateway refusals and session-level failures.

One place for the sentences the TUI, Desktop and dashboard print verbatim, so the
"what happened / what to do" shape stays consistent and the slash commands cited
(`/model`, `/new`, `/sessions`, `/retry`) exist on EVERY client this gateway serves (TUI,
Desktop, dashboard) — no client-only forms (`/sessions new`, `/setup`) and no single-surface
gestures stated as fact (Ctrl+C is copy on Desktop). Lead phrases that clients pattern-match
on (``Session busy``) are part of the wire contract — keep them.
