"""Server→client JSON-RPC requests: the backend asks the renderer a question and waits for the
response frame carrying the same ``id``.

JSON-RPC is peer-to-peer; this is the backend's half. Every "ask the renderer" bridge (clarify,
approval, sudo, secret, vault prompts, desktop GUI reads, MCP setup consent, the tour) is one
:func:`send` (blocking) or :func:`send_async` (queue-backed approvals) and one response frame from
the client — no paired ``*.request`` notification / ``*.respond`` method, no per-kind ``*.expire``.

Ids are ``srq-<12 hex>``: strings never collide with client-minted integer ids, and the random
part keeps a compute-host child's requests distinct from the parent's when both reach one socket.
A request that times out or is cancelled (interrupt, session close, shutdown) emits ONE
``request.cancel {id, method, reason}`` notification so every renderer tears the card down the
same way. A response for an id that is no longer open is dropped — the wait already returned.

Reconnect: unanswered requests are returned as ``open_requests`` by ``session.resume`` /
``session.activate`` / ``session.events.since`` (:func:`open_requests`); the shared TypeScript
channel re-delivers them as if they had just arrived, so the notification replay ring never
has to carry "a question still waiting for an answer".

Batch clarify keeps per-question locks (``clarify.lock`` → :func:`lock_answer`): answers stay
editable until every question is locked, locked answers survive a timeout, and the last lock
resolves the request with the full answer set.
