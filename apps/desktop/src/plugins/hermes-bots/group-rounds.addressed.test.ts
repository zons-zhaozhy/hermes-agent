/**
 * #129443 — the redundancy "(pass)" must not swallow an explicit address.
 *
 * The room's participation rules tell a member to reply only with something
 * new and otherwise "(pass)" — so in an @everyone turn the second member
 * passes whenever the first already answered, and a directly addressed
 * member's silence settles as ordinary consensus. The engine, not the prompt
 * wording, owns the invariant: `explicitlyAddressedMemberKeys` carries the
 * user's addresses as structured state, an addressed member's "(pass)" gets
 * ONE bounded nudge, and a second "(pass)" is recorded as an explicit
 * noncompliance (activity row + roster badge) instead of quiet silence.
 * Ordinary unaddressed collaborative "(pass)" is untouched.
