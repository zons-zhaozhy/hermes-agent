/**
 * `::ask{...}` — the model's interactive question, inline in its message.
 *
 * The conversational counterpart of a wall of text: whenever the agent needs
 * a decision, it emits ONE line and the transcript renders real controls —
 * option pills; a single click submits the pick as a visible user turn.
 * Works in every session (it is a core transcript directive, not an
 * onboarding-only one), so dashboard button responses, refinement dialogues,
 * and ordinary chats can all fork interactively.
 *
 *   ::ask{question="Which angle leads?" options="Lead story|Exclusive|Embargoed brief"}
 *   ::ask{question="Paste the runway number" input="true"}
 *
 * Options are pipe-separated. `input="true"` means a typed answer is welcome —
 * that keeps the QUESTION rendering even with no options, but it draws no
 * input row of its own: the composer is always right below the transcript,
 * and a second "type here" bar beside it read as clutter (first live-run
 * feedback). A pick submits VISIBLY so the user sees their choice become a
 * turn.
