/**
 * Attachment-rewrite tolerance for pasted attachments (#120978, follow-up to
 * #119326).
 *
 * A pasted clipboard attachment has no rowId on the optimistic local row, and
 * the backend rewrites the durable prompt around it: the caption survives but
 * the refs become `[Image attached at: <path>]` / `[screenshot]` markers, and a
 * `<memory-context>…</memory-context>` block can be injected. Exact text+refs
 * equality can never bridge that, so `hydratedIdFor()` returns undefined and
 * the conservative append path paints the local pair below the newest turn.
 *
 * The tolerance is gated on ATTACHMENT EVIDENCE on both sides so a plain
 * repeated prompt — or a second attempt under the same caption — is never
 * swallowed: the stored row must carry rewrite markers AND the local row must
 * carry its own attachment evidence (refs or markers). A captionless paste —
 * whose tolerant caption is empty on both sides — never matches either: empty
 * cannot identify a turn, so it takes the conservative preserve path.
