 * it through here so there is exactly one applier and no forked confirm
 * logic per surface (#95293).
 *
 * A refused switch is a decision, not a notification: it asks through
 * `confirm()` — the app's ConfirmDialog — so there is a real decline button,
 * Esc/backdrop/✕ all mean "keep current model", and the dialog owns focus
 * while it waits (#112458). Declining is free: nothing was applied. Only a
 * confirmed answer resends with `confirm_expensive_model: true`; a resend
 * that STILL answers `confirm_required` is treated as a failure — the gateway
 * asked twice, something is wrong; never loop.
 *
 * Resolves `true` when the switch was applied, `false` when it was declined,
 * went stale, or failed (a failure surfaces its own toast).
