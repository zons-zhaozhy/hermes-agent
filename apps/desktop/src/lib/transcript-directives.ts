/**
 * TRANSCRIPT DIRECTIVES — the transcript as a contribution area.
 *
 * A plugin registers a named directive; the model addresses it by emitting a
 * paragraph of the form `::name{key="value"}` and that leaf renders as the
 * plugin's component, inline in the assistant message. This is the deliberate
 * counterpart to artifact promotion: artifacts are heuristic (substantial
 * fences get promoted whether or not the model asked), directives are
 * addressed (nothing renders unless a plugin claimed the name).
 *
 * The product parser requires the entire paragraph to be one directive, so
 * mid-prose text and malformed or unclaimed directives stay prose.
 *
 * For the guided chat segmenter, the guard is the CLAIM, not its position:
 * a name nobody registered — and a malformed one — stays exactly the text it
 * always was. Position used to be the guard too (a directive had to be the
 * whole paragraph), and that cost more than it bought: a model that wrote the
 * directive at the end of its sentence instead of alone under it put raw
 * `::onboarding{step="look"}` in front of the user AND swallowed the card,
 * which on a step whose card is the only way forward stops the conversation
 * dead. So a directive is recognised wherever it starts a word, and the
 * paragraph around it keeps rendering as prose.
 *
 * Attributes are untrusted model output: plugins validate their own fields.
