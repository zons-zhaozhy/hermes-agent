/**
 * Structural grouping for a comment batch.
 *
 * Twenty-three comments used to arrive as twenty-three flat blocks, so the
 * agent made twenty-three todos and worked them one at a time. The fix is not
 * a classifier in the renderer — "is this a UI nit or a functional bug" is a
 * judgment only the model can make, and prose-matching it here would be wrong
 * constantly. What the renderer CAN know is structure: which pins sit in the
 * same part of the DOM, and therefore which ones are likely the same component
 * and the same source file.
 *
 * So this splits the batch by shared ancestor path and hands the model groups
 * that touch disjoint subtrees. Disjoint is the property that makes parallel
 * work safe — grouping by theme instead ("all the UI ones") would put five
 * agents in the same files. The model still owns the semantics and can regroup;
 * these are labelled starting points, not orders.
 *
 * Two properties keep the split honest without a tuning knob:
 *
 * - It compares ANCESTOR paths, not full selectors. Two comments on the heading
 *   and the paragraph of one card differ at the leaf, and splitting there would
 *   hand out singletons — the thing this exists to prevent. Their parents are
 *   identical, so they group.
 * - The depth is derived, then refined: descend the shared prefix until it
 *   stops being shared, and sub-split any group that ends up holding most of
 *   the batch. So the group count follows the page the user commented on rather
 *   than a constant someone picked.
