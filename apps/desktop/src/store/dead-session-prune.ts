/**
 * Prune renderer-stored session references whose sessions no longer exist on
 * the backend.
 *
 * Pins (`hermes.desktop.pinnedSessions`), composer drafts
 * (`hermes:composer-drafts:v3`) and queued prompts
 * (`hermes.desktop.composerQueue.v1`) are keyed by session id and re-asserted
 * or probed at boot. When a session is removed from state.db (retention purge,
 * manual delete, another surface pruning it), those keys go stale: nothing
 * ever drops them, so every boot re-requests the dead ids and the gateway
 * answers `404 {"detail":"Session not found"}` once per stale reference,
 * forever.
 *
 * This module sweeps for dead ids after the sidebar list has spoken. A session
 * is declared dead ONLY when a by-id probe 404s on every known profile — a 404
 * is profile-scoped ("not on this profile's state.db"), so a single miss never
 * prunes anything (a session can legitimately live on a non-active profile).
 * Any non-404 probe failure (gateway mid-restart, network) is inconclusive:
 * the id is deferred to a later pass instead of being dropped.
