/**
 * The live connector catalog for a chat session, read once per session and cached.
 *
 * The onboarding picker used to be a hardcoded list, and it drifted from the
 * deployed catalog: it offered apps the gateway does not carry and spelled
 * others with hyphens the gateway does not use. The build chat then had to
 * tell the user the pick could not be connected. This hook asks the gateway
 * what is there, through the account-owned RPC the Connectors page uses, on
 * the backend that owns the session, so the picker can only offer what can be
 * connected. The session-owned list answers for the session's own tools, and
 * the setup profile carries only its beat tools, so it always said no.
 *
 * `available: false` (toolset off, signed out), a failed request, and a
 * request that takes longer than 15 s all resolve to `unavailable`; the caller
 * decides what to show. There is no fallback list here, because a fallback is
 * how the drift started. Missing session ids resolve to `unavailable` too,
 * and the probe runs once they arrive, so the card never waits on a request
 * that was never sent.
