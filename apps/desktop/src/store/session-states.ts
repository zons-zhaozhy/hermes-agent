/**
 * MULTI-SESSION VIEW STATE — the reactive face of the per-runtime session
 * cache (`sessionStateByRuntimeIdRef` in use-session-state-cache).
 *
 * The cache already ingests EVERY session's gateway events; only the view
 * was single-session ($messages + the active-id gate). This store mirrors
 * the cache per runtime id so any number of surfaces (session tiles, future
 * pane windows) can each subscribe to one session's state without touching
 * the main chat's `$messages` pipeline — same pattern as `useSessionSlice`
 * over `$todosBySession`, applied to whole `ClientSessionState`s.
 *
 * TILES are the first consumer: sessions opened side-by-side with the main
 * thread, each in its own layout-tree pane. `$sessionTiles` holds the
 * stored-session ids (persisted — tiles survive restarts); the wiring layer
 * owns resume/submit (it has the gateway + cache internals) and registers
 * itself here as the delegate so tile UI stays dependency-light.

 *  forever: the sidebar running arc and agents-panel "running" chrome lie for
 *  hours after the turn actually ended (#53902, #73082 — stale-flag half).
 *
 *  `scope` picks which socket's sessions to reconcile, keyed by the event-
 *  source scope recorded at fan-in: a SECONDARY (registry) reconnect passes
 *  its composite scope and touches only runtimes that arrived on that socket;
 *  the PRIMARY reconnect passes undefined and touches only scope-less
 *  runtimes (primary/local events record no scope). Neither can clear live
 *  work riding a different, still-healthy connection.
 *
 *  Direction of failure is deliberate: a turn that IS still live (transient
 *  socket blip, same backend) re-asserts busy on its next event or inflight
 *  snapshot within a beat, so at worst its arc blinks once. A dead turn's
 *  state, by contrast, would never clear on its own. `needsInput` is left
 *  untouched — a blocking prompt is the one claim the user must explicitly
 *  answer, and post-reconnect refresh re-asserts or retires it via its own
 *  path. Transition side-effects run through publishSessionState, so
 *  watchdogs disarm, stall hints drop, and settle/unread bookkeeping stays
 *  consistent.
 *
 *  The downgrade goes through the delegate's `retireBusyClaim` (the wiring
 *  cache's updateSessionState), not straight into this mirror: the claim has
 *  four holders — wiring cache, mirror, the focused view's draft latches,
 *  busyRef — and retiring only the mirror left Send silently no-oping behind
 *  a stale busy until restart (#93059). The mirror publish stays as the
 *  fallback for runtimes the cache never held (background-sync rows, no
 *  wiring mounted). A PRIMARY reconcile also clears the focused draft
 *  latches, which outlive the state they mirrored; a scoped one leaves them
