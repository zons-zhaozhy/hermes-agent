// ── Session-scoped RPC routing (the #89206 class) ───────────────────────────
// A session-scoped RPC (session.resume / session.activate / session.usage)
// only means anything on the backend that OWNS the session's profile. The
// ambient "active gateway" is a moving target: between the profile-swap await
// and the RPC dispatch, a concurrent switch, an idle-reap eviction, a failed
// dial, or a connection edit can re-point the active route at another
// backend. Dispatching on it anyway lands the RPC on a backend that has never
// heard of the session — it 404s or times out, the renderer burns its bounded
// retries, and the user sees "retries gave up" while the session's own
// backend is healthy (blank Bot Chats, dead wake-ups; local pool and SSH
// alike). These helpers make the owning profile, resolved at REQUEST time,
// the routing authority.
