/**
 * Keep-awake — stop the machine sleeping during long, unattended runs.
 *
 * A device-local preference (each computer keeps its own), off by default. This
 * atom backs the Settings → Advanced picker and mirrors changes to the main
 * process, which owns the real power-save blocker AND its own persisted copy —
 * so a cold launch restores the blocker without the renderer visiting Settings
 * (see electron/main.ts + electron/power-save.ts). Linux/web without the bridge
 * just no-op.
 *
 * Modes: 'off' never holds the blocker; 'while-working' holds it only while a
 * turn is in flight (main reads that from the same active-work reports that
 * drive stream throttling); 'always' holds it around the clock, which is what
 * the pre-mode boolean toggle meant when it was on.
