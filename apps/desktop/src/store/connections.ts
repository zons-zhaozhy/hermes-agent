 *     is exactly how that id leaked to the new backend and came back as
 *     "session not found" (#93937).
 *
 * Overlap and stalls: clicks can supersede a switch at any point. A switch
 * superseded while queued behind another activation declines its commit —
 * no wipe, no activation — so the winner's wipe is always the one that
 * precedes the final publication, and the barrier is owned by the latest
 * switch. Every await is bounded; a commit that stalls after the wipe lowers
 * the barrier and repaints the source that is still active.
