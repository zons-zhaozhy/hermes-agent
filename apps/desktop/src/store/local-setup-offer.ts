/**
 * The local-setup offer: "this machine can run a model locally" for every
 * machine that qualifies, delivered by state transitions, never by a timer.
 *
 * Three surfaces read this one record:
 *
 * - The handoff tour ends on the model pill (`signpost.ts`) when the machine
 *   qualifies. Every guided user who reaches the handoff sees it.
 * - A card above the primary composer after the first finished turn once
 *   onboarding is over (handoff or skip). It renders only while that session
 *   is idle, so an automatic follow-up turn hides it and the next idle shows it.
 * - A "Run locally" row at the top of the model menu, until setup is done.
 *
 * States move only on events: `armed` when onboarding ends, `shown` on the
 * first eligible `message.complete`, `dismissed` on ✕, `accepted` on the card's
 * button. Local setup completing ends it by eligibility: a machine with a
 * runtime and a staged model no longer qualifies, so every surface hides.
 *
 * The predecessor was a tip in the rotation: 5-10 min settle, a six-hour
 * cooldown shared with every tip, a quiet check, a 22 s linger, and a 7-day
 * reshow. It fired on rtxspark and vespyr with nobody watching and recorded
 * itself as shown, which hid it for a week.
