/**
 * The owner a session tile routes its own RPCs through — the tile's explicit
 * route first, then the session row's `(connection, profile)` tag, with
 * `knownSessionOwner` folding in the owner hint.
 *
 * A tile opened without an explicit route — a branch child, which
 * `openSessionTile` creates with no `workspaceScope` — has no tile route, so
 * the row/hint rung is the only thing keeping its model and composer RPCs on
 * the backend that owns the session instead of the ambient one.
 *
 * A bare profile string carries no connection and is not a usable route:
 * handing it to `requestForSessionProfile` would resolve it against whichever
 * connection is active, which is the bug this ladder exists to avoid.
