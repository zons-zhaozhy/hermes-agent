/**
 * Paste-to-focus: the paste twin of type-to-focus. A ⌘V/Ctrl+V landing on
 * non-editable chrome (the transcript, empty chat, the window body) routes the
 * clipboard into the active composer instead of dying on the body — images
 * attach, text inserts (links/paths chipping exactly like a focused paste),
 * and the composer takes focus so the user keeps typing.
 *
 * Clipboard data is only readable synchronously inside the paste event, so the
 * window listener extracts everything here and the payload rides the composer
 * bus. Editable targets keep their own paste handlers, and the same surfaces
 * that block type-to-focus (dialogs, menus, terminal, full pages) block this.
