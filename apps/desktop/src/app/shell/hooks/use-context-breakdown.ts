/** The focused session's context breakdown, fetched as soon as the statusbar
 *  gauge is on screen rather than when its popover opens.
 *
 *  The backend only reports measured context occupancy (`last_prompt_tokens`)
 *  once a turn has run in THIS process, so a resumed session reports none —
 *  which is why turning the gauge on used to do nothing at all until you sent
 *  a message. `session.context_breakdown` estimates the same figure from the
 *  live system prompt + tools + transcript, so it answers for a session that
 *  hasn't spoken yet. It is a read-only chars/4 pass: no provider call, no
 *  prompt-cache impact.
 *
 *  Refetches when the focused session changes and when a turn ends (the
 *  transcript just grew). Held keyed by the session it describes so switching
 *  sessions drops the previous numbers instead of painting them under the new
 *  session's name.
 *
 *  Two events change the transcript WITHOUT a busy toggle, so the refetch
 *  must be driven explicitly:
 *
 *  - **Compression** — manual `/compress` runs the `session.compress` RPC
 *    outside any turn (busy never flips), and auto-compression can commit
 *    mid-turn. The post-compression transcript measures a fraction of the
 *    pre-compression size, so a served pre-compression breakdown is not
 *    merely stale, it is wrong by 5-10x (#94001).
 *  - **Reclaim** (`session.reclaimed`) — the runtime is reaped and the
 *    session re-resumes; the first refetch can race the agent rebuild.
 *
 *  `invalidateContextBreakdown` bumps a per-session generation that both
 *  call sites (slash.ts after a successful compress, lifecycle.ts on
 *  reclaim) fire, forcing an immediate refetch. An untrustworthy answer —
 *  an outright failure, or a ZEROED breakdown from the backend's
 *  agent-is-None branch (`context_max: 0`) — retries on a bounded backoff;
 *  once the ladder is exhausted the cached breakdown is EVICTED so the
 *  meter goes dark honestly rather than showing numbers known to be
 *  stale. */
