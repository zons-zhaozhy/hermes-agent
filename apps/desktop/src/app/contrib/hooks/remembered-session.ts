 * Returns the session safe to remember/restore: a delegate child
 * (`source === 'subagent'`) is replaced by its parent, everything else keeps
 * its own id. Delegate children are deliberately omitted from the sidebar list
 * (`_LISTABLE_CHILD_SQL`), so remembering one leaves the next cold start split
 * between the highlighted parent and the invisible child the chat area shows
 * (#56983). `/branch` children also carry `parent_session_id` but ARE
 * user-facing — `source`, not parenthood, is the discriminator.
 *
 * Accepts metadata fetched directly by id (`getSession`): the by-id endpoint
 * serves delegate children even though the list does not, so this repairs a
 * stale child id without the sidebar list. `null` means "do not remember"
 * (an orphaned delegate child whose parent is gone).
