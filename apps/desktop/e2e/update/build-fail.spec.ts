/**
 * Failure class: APP-DRIVEN UPDATE whose Desktop build fails.
 *
 * #124040: the Desktop build failed inside the update takeover's completion
 * stage and the failure was swallowed / kept looping instead of reaching the
 * user. Here upstream main carries a Desktop source file that does not
 * compile; the user clicks "Update now". The update must end with the app
 * telling the user the update FAILED (the relaunched app's result dialog is
 * logged as `[updates] detached update FAILED`), never "finished OK", and the
 * updater must not be left running.
