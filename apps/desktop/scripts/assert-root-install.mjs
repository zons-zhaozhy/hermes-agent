// Build-time guard: refuse to start a build the installed tree cannot finish.
//
// The desktop workspace's dependencies are hoisted to the repo-root
// `node_modules`, so a root install that only covers *part* of the workspace
// graph leaves this app importable-looking but unbuildable. The guard exists to
// turn that into one actionable line ("run npm ci from the repo root") instead
// of a failure deep inside vite.
//
// It runs from `prebuild`, ahead of `npm run clean`, so a tree that cannot
// build is rejected before the build starts deleting its own outputs. `build`
// re-runs it for anyone invoking the build steps directly; the check is pure
// filesystem lookups, so paying for it twice costs nothing.

// Packages the build *consumes*, as opposed to merely declares. Each one is
// load-bearing for a distinct build step, and each one has been observed
// missing from a partial root install:
//
//   vite            — bundles the renderer (`vite build`).
//   katex           — `src/styles.css` imports `katex/dist/katex.min.css`, so
//                     the CSS transform fails before a single chunk is emitted.
//   electron        — the runtime electron-builder packages; without it `pack`
//                     cannot produce an unpacked app at all.
//   electron-builder — the packager `npm run builder` shells out to.
//
// Checking only `vite` (the original guard) passes a tree missing any of the
// others, which is how an incomplete install reached `vite build` and died on
// an unresolved `katex/dist/katex.min.css` with no hint that the install — not
// the source — was at fault (#86443).
//
// These four are the documented floor — always checked, even when the app's
// package.json cannot be read. The full class is wider: EVERY non-optional
// package the workspace manifest declares is something the build may import
// (`vite.config.ts` pulls `@rolldown/plugin-babel`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`,
// `@tailwindcss/vite`; `bundle-electron-main.mjs` pulls `esbuild`; the renderer
// imports the rest). A hand-maintained list drifts the moment a new import
// lands, so `checkRootInstall` unions the floor with the manifest's declared
// `dependencies` + `devDependencies` — a partial install is refused whichever
// package it happened to drop. `optionalDependencies` are excluded by design:
// npm legitimately skips them (platform-gated natives like `get-windows`).
