// Electron logs "Error occurred in handler for 'hermes:api'" with a full stack
// trace for every rejected `ipcMain.handle` invoke, and offers no way to opt a
// handler out. Desktop's session resolution is a deliberate probe ladder
// (`resolveStoredSession`: cache → active backend → each other profile), so a
// 404 there is a normal rung outcome the renderer already handles — but each
// one printed a stack into the launching terminal.
//
// The handler therefore RESOLVES with this sentinel for that one expected case,
// and preload rethrows it as an ordinary `Error` carrying the identical
// `404: <body>` message. The renderer sees exactly the rejection it saw before;
// only Electron's logging is bypassed. Any other failure rejects as usual and
// still logs in full.
