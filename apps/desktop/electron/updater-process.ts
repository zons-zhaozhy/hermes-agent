 * published — which historically lags main by months and strands users on
 * long-fixed bugs (cache resolver #67369, marker self-adopt #74782; the
 * 2026-08-09 incident chain). `scripts/desktop-update.ps1` lives in the repo
 * checkout instead: every `hermes update` refreshes the code that drives the
 * NEXT update, and only PowerShell itself is frozen.
 *
 * Returns the spawn recipe when the script exists in the checkout, or null
 * (caller falls back to the staged binary — old checkouts that predate the
 * script keep working unchanged). Windows-only by the same policy as
 * resolveStagedUpdaterBinary: POSIX updates in place via
 * applyUpdatesPosixInApp and needs no hand-off at all.

 * exits 0 WITHOUT executing a single line of the script. powershell.exe is a

 * the launch side). The same spawn with a visible console, or non-detached,
 * runs fine — so unit tests and foreground use hide the bug.
 *
 * `cmd /c start "" /min powershell ...` was the variant that survived the
 * full detached+hidden production shape in testing: `start` allocates the
 * child its own (minimized) console and fully detaches it from cmd.exe,
 * which exits immediately. The spawned pid is therefore the WRAPPER's —
 * callers must not use it as a marker owner (the script claims the marker

 * `bootstrap::copy_self_to_hermes_home`), so finding that binary on macOS or
 * Linux is expected, not leftover junk.
 *
 * Handing an update to it is nonetheless a Windows-only policy. Windows needs
 * the quit -> hand-off -> rebuild dance because a venv shim file lock keeps the
 * running desktop from rewriting its own bits; macOS and Linux have no such
 * lock and update in place through applyUpdatesPosixInApp(). Off Windows the
 * hand-off therefore buys nothing and costs a great deal: a staged binary older
 * than the hand-off protocol holds the update marker, spawns `hermes update`,
 * and that child refuses its own parent — wedging the in-app Update button for
 * good, with no route (update, re-download, reinstall) to a newer binary
 * (#74836). Returning null off Windows is what routes those platforms to the
 * in-app updater.
 *
 * Null on Windows too when nothing is staged (a dev/source run, or a CLI
 * install that never went through the installer); callers degrade gracefully.

 * user's ORIGINAL install orchestrates every later update — forever. Installers
 * predating #74782 have no self-PID exclusion in `UpdateMarkerGuard::acquire`,
 * so when the desktop pre-writes the marker naming that very updater, the
 * updater reads its own claim as a foreign live owner and aborts with
 * "Another Hermes update is already running (PID <itself>, started 1s ago)" —
 * the observed infinite "Install didn't finish" loop. Skipping the pre-write
 * for those binaries lets them acquire cleanly and run `hermes update`, which
 * pulls the permanent fixes. See shouldPrewriteUpdateMarker.
 *
 * We cannot ask the binary its version without executing it, so use its mtime:
 * the installer is written to HERMES_HOME at install/repair time, making mtime
 * a faithful stamp of which installer generation produced it.
 *
 * Unreadable mtime counts as UNSUPPORTED — the pre-write is a best-effort
 * hardening, while a wedged updater is unrecoverable, so we bias toward the
