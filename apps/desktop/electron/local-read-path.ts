// reported target to the hardening resolvers. On a Windows host with a WSL
// backend the target is a WSL/POSIX path (`/home/...`, `/mnt/c/...`) the
// Windows fs can't open as-is, so each boundary must route the raw path
// through resolveLocalReadPath (a no-op off Windows / for already-Windows
// paths) before it reaches the resolver. Kept here — mirroring fs-read-dir —
// so the wiring is exercised in isolation instead of buried in main.ts.
