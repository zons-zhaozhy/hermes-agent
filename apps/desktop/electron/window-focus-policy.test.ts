/**
 * Invariants for the Windows foreground-steal fix (#83998).
 *
 * `focusWindow()` runs for every ambient window raise (tray restore,
 * notification click, second-instance, dock/taskbar activate). On Windows,
 * `show()` + unconditional `focus()` seizes the OS foreground and dismisses
 * other apps' native dialogs while Hermes streams in the background. The
 * main-process call sites now follow the policy in window-focus-policy.ts;
 * these tests pin it.
