"""Park unmentioned MSC3245 voice messages until the sender's bare @mention claims them.

Element X sends a mention typed while recording as a SEPARATE ``m.text`` event after the
voice event (which carries an empty ``m.mentions``). Under ``require_mention`` the voice is
parked instead of forgotten; a bare mention from the same sender in the same room within
the window claims it. Unmentioned voices are never downloaded or transcribed while parked.
