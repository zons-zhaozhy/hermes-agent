"""OpenAI native web search — declares the Responses API server-side ``web_search`` built-in.

Config: ``web.search_backend: openai-native`` (or ``web.backend``).
Auth: openai-codex OAuth (``hermes auth add openai-codex``); no API key of its own.

Unlike every other provider here, this one never executes a search itself. Selecting it
tells the Codex Responses transport to declare the provider-executed ``web_search`` tool
(``{"type": "web_search"}``) in place of the client-side ``web_search`` function, so the
model drives search server-side. The transport performs that swap; this class exists so
``web.search_backend`` has a real provider name to point at.

Auth gating lives here rather than in the transport because the transport must stay
reachable for a user who configured this backend but has not signed in yet — they get the
clear "sign in" error from :meth:`search` rather than a silently different backend.
