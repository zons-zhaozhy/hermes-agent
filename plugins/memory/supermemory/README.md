# Supermemory Memory Provider

Semantic long-term memory with profile recall, semantic search, explicit memory tools, and per-turn conversation capture into one document per session per 4-hour window for richer profiles.

## Requirements

- `pip install supermemory`
- Hosted: API key from [app.supermemory.ai/integrations?connect=hermes](http://app.supermemory.ai/integrations?connect=hermes)
- Self-hosted: a running [Supermemory local](https://supermemory.ai/docs/self-hosting/overview) server and the API key it prints on first boot

## Setup

```bash
hermes memory setup    # select "supermemory"
```

Or manually:

```bash
hermes config set memory.provider supermemory
echo 'SUPERMEMORY_API_KEY=***' >> ~/.hermes/.env
```

For a fully self-hosted setup, start Supermemory local and note the API key it
prints on first boot:

```bash
npx supermemory local
```

Before running `hermes memory setup`, add the local endpoint to
`$HERMES_HOME/supermemory.json`:

```json
{
  "base_url": "http://localhost:6767"
}
```

Then run `hermes memory setup` and enter the local server's API key. Configuring
the endpoint first ensures the setup connection probe also stays local.

## Config

Config file: `$HERMES_HOME/supermemory.json`

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `base_url` | `https://api.supermemory.ai` | API endpoint for hosted or self-hosted Supermemory. Takes priority over `SUPERMEMORY_BASE_URL`. |
| `container_tag` | `hermes` | Container tag used for search and writes. Supports `{identity}` template for profile-scoped tags (e.g. `hermes-{identity}` → `hermes-coder`). |
| `auto_recall` | `true` | Inject relevant memory context before turns |
| `auto_capture` | `true` | Store cleaned user-assistant turns after each response |
| `max_recall_results` | `10` | Max recalled items to format into context |
| `profile_frequency` | `50` | Include profile facts on first turn and every N turns |
| `capture_mode` | `all` | Skip tiny or trivial turns by default |
| `search_mode` | `hybrid` | Search mode: `hybrid` (profile + memories), `memories` (memories only), `documents` (documents only) |
| `entity_context` | built-in default | Extraction guidance passed to Supermemory |
| `api_timeout` | `5.0` | Timeout for SDK requests |

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SUPERMEMORY_API_KEY` | API key (required) |
| `SUPERMEMORY_BASE_URL` | Compatibility fallback for the API endpoint when `base_url` is not configured |
| `SUPERMEMORY_CONTAINER_TAG` | Override container tag (takes priority over config file) |

Base URL precedence is `supermemory.json` → `SUPERMEMORY_BASE_URL` →
`https://api.supermemory.ai`. Hermes resolves it once and uses the same endpoint
for SDK operations and setup/status probes.

## Tools

Kebab-case names are registered for the agent; snake_case aliases remain supported.

| Tool | Alias | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `supermemory-save` | `supermemory_store` | Store an explicit memory |
| `supermemory-search` | `supermemory_search` | Search memories by semantic similarity |
| `supermemory-forget` | `supermemory_forget` | Forget a memory by ID or best-match query |
| `supermemory-profile` | `supermemory_profile` | Retrieve persistent profile and recent context |

## Source attribution

All Supermemory API calls send `x-sm-source: hermes`, and document writes stamp
`metadata.sm_source: hermes`. This is a **functional routing key, not telemetry**:
it groups Hermes-written memories into a dedicated "Hermes" Space in the
Supermemory app, so you can filter, browse, and bulk-manage them per source agent
(alongside Codex, Claude Code, etc.) from the Supermemory UI.

## Behavior

When enabled, Hermes can:

- prefetch relevant memory context before each turn
- write each completed user/assistant turn to **one document per session per 4-hour window** (`customId` = `<session>_<date>_b<0-5>`, so the API appends deltas), matching the capture shape of the other Supermemory agent integrations
- retry failed turn writes on the next turn, session end, `/reset`, or shutdown (at-least-once: if the API accepted a write but the response was lost, the same turn is appended again)
- route every SDK and probe request through the configured hosted or self-hosted endpoint
- expose explicit tools for search, store, forget, and profile access


## Profile-Scoped Containers

Use `{identity}` in the `container_tag` to scope memories per Hermes profile:

```json
{
  "container_tag": "hermes-{identity}"
}
```

For a profile named `coder`, this resolves to `hermes-coder`. The default profile resolves to `hermes-default`. Without `{identity}`, all profiles share the same container.

## Multi-Container Mode

For advanced setups (e.g. OpenClaw-style multi-workspace), you can enable custom container tags so the agent can read/write across multiple named containers:

```json
{
  "container_tag": "hermes",
  "enable_custom_container_tags": true,
  "custom_containers": ["project-alpha", "project-beta", "shared-knowledge"],
  "custom_container_instructions": "Use project-alpha for coding tasks, project-beta for research, and shared-knowledge for team-wide facts."
}
```

When enabled:
- `supermemory-search`, `supermemory-save`, `supermemory-forget`, and `supermemory-profile` accept an optional `container_tag` parameter
- The tag must be in the whitelist: primary container + `custom_containers`
- Automatic operations (turn capture, prefetch, memory write mirroring) always use the **primary** container only
- Custom container instructions are injected into the system prompt
