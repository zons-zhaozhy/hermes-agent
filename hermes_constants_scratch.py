"""Scratch-dir retention: idle detection plus the reaping an idle tree needs before it goes.

Deleting an idle ``cache/scratch/<entry>`` is not enough on its own: a lane's e2e run leaves
headless browsers whose cwd was inside the tree (they survived for days with a ``(deleted)``
cwd), and a repo whose linked worktree lived in the tree keeps a dangling registration until
someone runs ``git worktree prune``. Both are reaped here, right before ``rmtree``.
