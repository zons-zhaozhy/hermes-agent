"""Classify a PR's changed files into CI work lanes.

Reads newline-separated changed paths on stdin and writes ``key=value``
booleans (one per lane) to ``$GITHUB_OUTPUT`` and stdout. The
``detect-changes`` composite action consumes them so steps gate on
``if: steps.changes.outputs.<lane> == 'true'``.

Lanes:

* ``python``      — pytest / ruff / ty / footguns.
* ``python_prod`` — Python changes OUTSIDE tests/. A tests-only PR keeps
  ``python`` (pytest must run) while this stays off.
* ``docker_meta`` — Dockerfiles etc.
* ``docker``      — the image build: docker meta, the dependency manifests, PM,
  and the image's own tests.
* ``nix``         — ``nix flake check``: the flake files and the dependency
  manifests.
* ``e2e``, ``e2e_upgrade``, ``e2e_desktop_core``, ``e2e_desktop_update`` —
  the end-to-end suites. Each runs on a pull request only when the PR edits
  that suite or the code the suite exists to guard (``_E2E_LANES``), or
  carries the ``run-e2e`` label.
* ``frontend``    — TS typecheck matrix + desktop build.
* ``site``        — Docusaurus + generated skill docs.
* ``scan``        — supply-chain scan (Python files, .pth, setup hooks).
* ``deps``        — pyproject.toml dependency bounds check.
* ``uv_lock``     — ``PM lock check``. Re-resolves the whole graph against
  PyPI, so a diff that touches neither ``pyproject.toml`` nor ``uv.lock``
  must not run it.
* ``npm_lock``    — semantic package-lock.json diff PR comment.
* ``bootstrap``   — the bootstrap installer lane: install.sh sandbox install,
  pin-fragment drift check, and shipped version-stamp verification.
* ``desktop_updater`` — the Windows desktop-update hand-off script and the
  tests that drive the REAL ``windows.ps1`` (``-SelfTestUi`` / pipe drain /
  retry policy). These are integration tests of a PowerShell process on a
  shared runner; running them on every Python PR made their timing noise
  everyone's problem. They still run on push (fail-open) and whenever the
  script, its siblings, or their tests change.
* ``rust``        — ``cargo test`` for the Tauri bootstrap installer. ``.rs``
  lives under ``apps/``, so without this lane a Rust change matched ``frontend``
  and only the TypeScript matrix ran.

``docker``, ``nix`` and the E2E lanes take most of the larger-runner minutes.
An ordinary product change does not start them on a pull request. Every push
to main runs them all (a push has no diff, so every lane is on), so a
regression they catch shows up on main after the merge. A stable-release run
forces every lane on.

Contract — *fail open, never closed*. We may run a lane we didn't need, but
must never skip one a change could break:

* The slow lanes above are the one deliberate exception. On a pull request
  they skip changes that could still break them, and main is where those
  changes meet the suite. Their path lists decide which PRs run them early.
* An empty diff, or any ``.github/`` change, runs everything.
* ``python`` is a denylist: skipped only when *every* file is provably prose
  or a frontend-only package; an unrecognized path keeps it on.
* ``skills/`` (incl. ``SKILL.md``) is python-relevant — the skill-doc tests
  read that tree, so a doc-looking edit can still break Python.
* ``nix/``, ``flake.nix`` and ``flake.lock`` are the exception the other way:
  only the flake reads them, so they skip the Python lanes and run ``nix``
  alone. ``pyproject.toml`` and ``uv.lock`` are flake inputs too, but the
  packaging tests read them, so they keep every Python lane.
* ``website/static/oauth/`` is python-relevant too: it publishes the OAuth
  Client ID Metadata Document that ``tests/tools/test_mcp_cimd.py`` checks
  against the pinned callback ports in ``tools/mcp_oauth.py``.
* ``website/docs/`` and ``website/scripts/`` are python-relevant for the same
  reason: the docs tree generates ``llms.txt``, and
  ``tests/website/test_generate_llms_txt.py`` asserts every page reaches it.
