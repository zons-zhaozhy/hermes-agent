"""Live-updating CI review comment.

Polls the GitHub Actions API for job statuses in the CI run, assembles
the review comment from whatever results are available, and upserts it as a
PR comment. Repeats every ``--interval`` seconds until all jobs are
completed (or ``--timeout`` is reached), so the comment updates in real time
as each job finishes.

The comment is identified by the ``<!-- hermes-ci-review-bot -->`` marker
— the same one ``assemble_review_comment.py`` uses — so it replaces any
previous comment from an earlier run.

This runs from ``.github/workflows/ci-review-comment.yml``, a separate
``workflow_run`` workflow. Thus ``GITHUB_RUN_ID`` names the CI run to report
on, not the run that contains this script. The poller reports on runs that
it does not belong to. This is also how it covers a workflow that CI does
not contain: ``WATCH_WORKFLOWS`` names sibling workflows that the same
commit triggered (the Docker image build). Their jobs join the comment.

Architecture:

  - :func:`classify_jobs` (pure, testable) — takes a list of raw API job
    dicts and returns ``(completed, pending, job_urls)`` where ``completed``
    is a ``{name: result}`` dict (for :func:`assemble_review_comment.assemble`)
    and ``pending`` is a list of job names still running.

  - :func:`select_watched_runs` (pure, testable) — picks the sibling runs
    to merge in, newest attempt per workflow.

  - :func:`find_comment_id` / :func:`upsert_comment` — thin API wrappers.

  - :func:`fetch_all_review_statuses` — lists all ``review-status-*``
    artifacts on the CI run (GitHub attaches reusable-workflow
    artifacts to the caller run), downloads each, parses the
    ``review_status=`` line from ``review-status.json``, and merges into
    one array. Recomputed from source every poll cycle, so statuses
    appear as soon as each job uploads its artifact.

  - :func:`run` — the polling loop. Calls the API, classifies,
    fetches artifacts, assembles, upserts, sleeps, repeats. Before
    its final exit, it gives downstream jobs a short grace period
    to appear.

The orchestrator job names (detect, all-checks-pass, comment-live, etc.)
are excluded from the comment — they're infrastructure, not review signal.
