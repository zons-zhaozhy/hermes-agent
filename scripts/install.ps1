# 8.3 short-path normalization
# ============================================================================
# Windows generates an 8.3 short alias for a user-profile folder whose name
# contains a space ("First Last" -> FIRST~1.LAS), a dot, or an accented
# character. It can then expose %TEMP%, %TMP%, %LOCALAPPDATA%, %APPDATA% and
# %USERPROFILE% -- plus everything derived from them, including the default
# HERMES_HOME and InstallDir -- in that short form:
#   C:\Users\FIRST~1.LAS\AppData\Local\Temp
# PowerShell's FileSystem provider mishandles the aliased component once it
# reaches a provider cmdlet (Tee-Object -FilePath, Out-File, New-Item,
# Test-Path), throwing "An object at the specified path ... does not exist".
# Expanding every profile-rooted path back to long form once, up front, lets
# every downstream cmdlet and child process see something the provider can
# resolve. Three resolvers, tried in order, because no single one covers every
# host:
#   1. kernel32!GetLongPathNameW -- expands any 8.3 component regardless of
#      locale.
#   2. Scripting.FileSystemObject -- fallback where P/Invoke is blocked.
#   3. Profile-root substitution -- when the volume has 8.3 generation
#      disabled or the alias is stale, neither resolver can expand the name
#      because it no longer maps to anything on disk. The aliased component
#      is always the profile folder itself (everything below it was created
#      long), so swap in a profile root we can prove is long and reattach
#      the tail.
# All three degrade to returning the input untouched, so a host where none
# of them apply -- including non-Windows -- behaves exactly as before.
