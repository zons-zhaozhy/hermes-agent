"""Base vs head: the ratchet verdict.

Every unit has its own cap: a function or file already over target may not grow past the value
it has on the base revision; anything new must meet the target. Pattern rules compare multisets
of fingerprints, so fixing one violation and adding another still fails.

Code that moves keeps its cap and its existing violations. Head units are matched to base
units ONE-TO-ONE (a base unit is consumed by at most one head unit), in this order:

1. same file, same name, same body (unchanged code; reserved first, so a copy of it is new);
2. same file, same body (a rename, or an anonymous callback whose ordinal shifted);
3. any file, same body, when the origin's name is gone from its own file (a real move);
4. same file, same name (edited in place). Repeated names (Python `_`, `f#2`; TS `<anon>#3`)
   are one group per name, paired by body similarity, never by their source-order ordinal;
   the last unit left with a name is that name's unit, as for a unique name;
5. another file, same name, similar body (moved AND edited), only when the name is gone
   from its origin file and exactly one unit of that name left and one arrived unmatched.

Every base hit is then owned by exactly one head scope: the head unit its unit matched, else the
same scope in the file's head path. Each old occurrence pays for one new occurrence, never two.

An occurrence is old only if it still sits where it was: inside a unit whose body is unchanged
(matched by passes 1-3, so moves and renames keep their debt), or on a line that survives from
the base file (compared without comments or whitespace, so dropping an allow comment or
re-indenting is not new debt). An identical violation re-added on a new line is new, even in
the same function as one that was removed.

Splitting a file moves lines to ANOTHER file, where they cannot survive in place. Inside a
unit matched across files and edited (pass 5), lines are compared with the origin unit's, as
in an edit in place. At module level, a base occurrence whose line left its file pays, once,
for an identical occurrence arriving in another file in the same diff, when its whole
top-level statement moved unchanged (an import guard, a module constant). A copy is never a
move: the origin line survives, so nothing departed.
