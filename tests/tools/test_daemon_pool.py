"""Tests for tools.daemon_pool.DaemonThreadPoolExecutor.

The daemon pool exists so abandoned workers (interrupted/timed-out tool
batches, wedged memory-provider syncs) can never block interpreter exit:
stdlib ThreadPoolExecutor workers are non-daemon AND registered in
concurrent.futures.thread._threads_queues, whose atexit hook joins every
worker unconditionally — even after shutdown(wait=False).
