"""The strict lint config may only rewrite code to syntax the oldest supported Python runs.

ruff's version-gated autofixes (UP037 strips annotation quotes, UP017/UP006/UP007 swap in newer
spellings) are safe only for ``target-version`` and newer. The Python floor is ``requires-python``
in pyproject.toml; before 3.14 annotations are evaluated eagerly, so a quote stripped for a py314
target (a method annotated with its own class, a later-defined class) raises NameError at import
on 3.11-3.13. Pinning the target to the floor keeps every such fix valid on every supported Python.
