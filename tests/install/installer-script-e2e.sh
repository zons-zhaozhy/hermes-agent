# Prove a user who installed OLD via the installer script can reach HEAD.
#
# The POSIX sibling of tests/install/windows-e2e.ps1, sharing its
# staging trick and replacing the old bubblewrap sandbox: instead of a fake
# Internet (MITM proxy + upload-pack shim), every git process is pointed at a
# local bare clone with url.<file://serve.git>.insteadOf rewrites for both
# canonical repo URLs in a driver-owned GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL. The installer and
# updater run byte-for-byte against their real URLs and land on serve.git;
# `main` serves OLD during the install, then advances to HEAD for the update
# leg -- an update becomes available exactly the way it does for a real user.
# No bwrap, no slirp4netns, no TLS interception; the CI runner is disposable,
# so the host IS the sandbox.
#
# install.sh itself is not curl'd: the install leg runs the copy shipped AT
# the OLD ref (what a user who installed then actually executed), and the
# installer-script update leg runs HEAD's copy (what the website serves at
# update time).
#
# Phases (mirroring the windows driver):
#   stage      bare-clone this checkout to serve.git, park main at OLD
#   install    run OLD's scripts/install.sh under the redirect; assert the
#              install landed on OLD with a working `hermes`
#   update     advance served main to HEAD, apply ONE update method, assert
#              the checkout landed on HEAD with a working `hermes`
#
# Usage:
#   tests/install/installer-script-e2e.sh --update-method hermes-update|installer-script|installer-script+desktop
#                                         [--install-method installer-script|installer-script+desktop]
#                                         [--install-ref REF]
#
#   --install-method installer-script          the plain one-liner (default)
#                    installer-script+desktop  the one-liner with its desktop
#                                              stage opted in (--include-desktop)
#   --update-method  hermes-update      `hermes update`
#                    installer-script   re-run install.sh (HEAD's copy)
#                    installer-script+desktop  re-run with --include-desktop
#                    hermes-desktop-app-update  launch the app via `hermes
#                                       desktop` (spawn captured, Playwright
#                                       drives it) and click Update now
#   --install-ref    what to install first; anything git resolves. Default:
#                    the newest release tag in the checkout.
