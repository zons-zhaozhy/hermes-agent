# Windows Desktop GUI install + update E2E driver (the REAL user flow)
# ============================================================================
# Proves, on a real Windows machine, that a user who installs Hermes the way
# the website tells them to can then update to the commit under test through
# a real update surface -- with every leg driven through the GUI a user
# actually touches:
#
#   INSTALL   - downloads the production Hermes-Setup.exe from the website,
#               launches it HEADED, and AutoHotkey clicks Install, waits,
#               then clicks Launch. The real Electron Hermes.exe must appear.
#               The exe runs EXACTLY as shipped against serve.git, whose
#               `main` is parked at OLD (-InstallRef, default: the newest
#               release tag) -- so the install lands on OLD the same way a
#               user's install landed on whatever main served that day.
#   UPDATE    - OLD -> HEAD through the route selected by -Route:
#                 desktop    (implemented) launch the installed Hermes.exe
#                            under Playwright's Electron driver and CLICK
#                            Settings -> About -> "Update now". The
#                            production hand-off chain runs untouched:
#                            marker, app quit, detached updater, `hermes
#                            update`, desktop rebuild, RELAUNCH. Asserts
#                            target sha, marker cleanup, result JSON (when
#                            the script path wrote one), working hermes,
#                            and the relaunched app window.
#                 update     run `hermes update` from the installed venv
#                            (the CLI route a GUI user might take).
#                 installer  re-run the bootstrap installer over the
#                            existing install (download Hermes-Setup.exe
#                            again, AHK clicks Install; lands on HEAD).
#
# HOW THE STAGING WORKS (no MITM proxy, no network fakery):
#   We bare-clone the checkout into <workroot>\serve.git and point every git
#   process at it with url.<file-url>.insteadOf rewrites for the two
#   canonical repo URLs, via a driver-owned gitconfig selected with
#   GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL. (NOT GIT_CONFIG_COUNT/KEY_n/VALUE_n env config --
#   install.ps1 sets those itself and silently clobbers them.) The
#   installer's `git clone` and `hermes update`'s `git fetch origin`
#   transparently hit OUR bare repo. Its `main` serves OLD for the install
#   phase; the update phase advances it to HEAD -- an update becomes
#   available exactly the way it does for a real user. Installer and
#   updater run byte-for-byte as shipped; everything else (uv, PyPI, npm,
#   the installer's raw.githubusercontent install.ps1 download) uses the
#   real network, same as a user install.
#
# PROOF: screenshots at every renderer step (Playwright), full-desktop
# screenshots around the installer/AHK phases, a rolling desktop capture
# (every 3s) plus a continuous ffmpeg screen recording (recording.mkv) for
# both phases, ahk.log, and the hand-off log. All uploaded as CI artifacts.
#
# DEVIATIONS FROM PRODUCTION (each one deliberate and small):
#   * the git URL redirect itself
#   * serve.git gets uploadpack.allowAnySHA1InWant=true so the installer's
#     baked -Commit pin can be fetched from the redirected clone the same
#     way GitHub's upload-pack allows it.
#   * A dummy provider key is seeded after install so the update leg sees
#     the ready app shell instead of the onboarding overlay (a real
#     updating user has a configured provider).
#   * The git shim reports the official URL. Detached updaters can resolve a
#     different git.exe, so the test home also records that upstream setup was
#     declined. The file:// transport must not prompt to add a second remote.
#
# USAGE (local Windows box or CI):
#   powershell -File tests\install\windows-e2e.ps1 -Phase all
#   ... -Phase stage / install / update
#   Phases share state via <workroot>\shas.json, so CI can run them as
#   separate steps for readable logs. -InstallMethod and -Route are
#   orthogonal axes: the install phase dispatches on -InstallMethod, the
#   update phase on -Route, and install writes what update needs (paths,
#   how OLD landed) into the shared state - so any implemented update can
#   follow any implemented install.
