"""An utterance is dispatched only into the conversation it was captured for.

``_process_voice_input`` awaits WAV conversion and STT, then the gateway callback reads the guild's
binding as it is at that moment. A ``/voice join`` from another text channel during transcription
rewrote the binding, and the old utterance became a turn in the new conversation, with its prompt,
skills and replies. The listen loop transcribes a poll batch serially, so a later utterance of the
same batch must keep the binding of the batch, not one set during an earlier utterance's STT.
Speech the receiver still buffers when the binding moves is dropped too: a poll or leave flush
after the move must not stamp it with the new binding.
