"""Gateway shutdown quiesces its thread pool before closing state.db (#101093).

``_shutdown_executor()`` used to run *after* the SessionDB close block in
``_stop_impl``, and it never waited: ``cancel_futures`` only drops work that has
not started, and cancelling the awaiting task does not stop the worker thread
behind a ``run_in_executor`` future.  So blocking DB work could still be running
when ``SessionDB.close()`` checkpointed the WAL and let SQLite unlink the
sidecar.  The late write then reopens the handle (#94736) and mints a fresh WAL
generation behind that checkpoint, leaving teardown to checkpoint the same file
a second time from a connection the shutdown log never accounts for -- the
close-time page-write damage in #101093 and the split WAL generation in #101064.

The order is now: quiesce (bounded) -> close.
