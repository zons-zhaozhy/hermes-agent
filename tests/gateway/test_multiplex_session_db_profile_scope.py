"""Regression coverage for #88532.

A multiplexed gateway serves every profile from one process.  ``SessionStore``
used to bind a single ``SessionDB`` during ``__init__``, freezing it to the
process's own root home, so a named profile's sessions were physically written
to the root ``state.db`` even though ``_profile_runtime_scope`` had already
redirected ``get_hermes_home()`` for that turn.  The rows carried the correct
``profile_name``, which is why the only visible symptom was the desktop listing
a profile's session under the default bot: the desktop reads
``profiles/<name>/state.db``, which never received the write.

These tests pin the handle to the *active* scope rather than to construction
time.  ``test_write_under_profile_scope_lands_in_profile_store`` is the one
that reproduces the report; it fails against the pre-fix code with the session
row sitting in the root store.
