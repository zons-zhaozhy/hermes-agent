"""Tests for reply-to pointer injection in _prepare_inbound_message_text.

The `[Replying to: "..."]` prefix is a *disambiguation pointer*, not
deduplication. It must always be injected when the user explicitly replies
to a prior message — even when the quoted text already exists somewhere
in the conversation history. History can contain the same or similar text
multiple times, and without an explicit pointer the agent has to guess
which prior message the user is referencing.
