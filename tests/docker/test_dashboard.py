"""Harness: dashboard opt-in via HERMES_DASHBOARD.

Today (tini): dashboard starts once when HERMES_DASHBOARD=1; if it crashes
it stays dead. After Phase 2 (s6): dashboard starts once; if it crashes
it is restarted under supervision. The restart-after-crash test lives in
Phase 2 Task 2.5; this file only locks the opt-in surface (which must
not change between tini and s6).

Every ``docker exec`` here runs as the unprivileged ``hermes`` user
(via :func:`docker_exec`/:func:`docker_exec_sh` in conftest), matching
the realistic runtime context. See the conftest module docstring.
