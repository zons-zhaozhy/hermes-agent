"""Regression test: ``hermes dump`` reports a real git SHA inside the container.

``.dockerignore`` excludes ``.git``, so ``git rev-parse HEAD`` fails inside
the published image. CI writes ``install-stamp.json`` before ``docker build``
(scripts/write_install_stamp.py) and it is COPY'd to the canonical
``/opt/hermes/install-stamp.json``. ``hermes dump`` reads the
commit from that stamp through ``hermes_cli.version_info``.

A local ``docker build`` (the ``built_image`` fixture in
``tests/docker/conftest.py``) has no CI stamp — only the Dockerfile's
distribution-only fallback, whose all-zero commit version_info skips. In
that case ``hermes dump`` falls back to ``(unknown)``.

This test asserts both cases:

* When the stamp exists in the image, ``hermes dump`` must show the first 8
  characters of its commit, not ``(unknown)``.
* When the stamp is absent, ``hermes dump`` must show ``(unknown)`` — a guard
  against the helper inventing a SHA from another source.
