"""``scripts/run-in-hermes-env``: run a command in the Hermes environment, syncing only when needed.

The runner is what repo scripts hand themselves to from their shebang and what
``scripts/run_tests.sh`` re-executes under. Its decision worth pinning is
staleness: pm stamps each dependency input's mtime beside the installed-state
file ``__HERMES_ACTIVATED`` names, and any input whose mtime differs from its
stamp means the inherited environment may not match its inputs. Invert that
either way and the cost is invisible — a re-sync on every run, or a stale
environment that looks fine.

The stamps come from the real ``pm.environments`` writer, so these tests pin
the contract between what pm records and what the runner reads. Setup and the
pm environment reader are stubbed at their process boundary: setup announces
each run, the reader emits a sentinel and a PATH shim.

A ``python3`` shim goes on PATH because scripts run under the runner name
``python3``, which does not exist on stock Windows; the subject here is the
staleness branch, not interpreter resolution.
