"""Full-repo self-scan wrapper for scripts/check-windows-footguns.py.

scripts/check_subprocess_stdin.py has had a pytest wrapper (see
tests/tools/test_subprocess_stdin_guard.py's test_all_tui_subprocess_calls_
have_stdin) that runs the checker with its default full-scan behavior and
asserts a clean exit — so a normal pytest run of that file catches
regressions even when no one remembers to run the standalone script by hand.
check-windows-footguns.py had no equivalent: only a narrow rule-level test
(tests/scripts/test_footgun_subprocess_encoding.py, scoped to the
text=True/encoding= rule) existed, so a bare ``os.killpg``/``signal.SIGKILL``
regression (caught by CI running the real script with --all, not by any
local pytest run) shipped in the T1-T3 npx-agent-browser hardening commit
before anyone ran the script directly. This closes that gap the same way
the stdin guard already closes its equivalent one.
