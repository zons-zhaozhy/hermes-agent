"""``GET /api/health`` ``commit`` contract (review G4).

Desktop's host-backend-attach.ts (``fetchBackendCodeIdentity``) reads ``commit`` from the public
health probe and refuses to attach to a backend whose BOOT commit differs from its checkout, so a
``serve`` that outlived ``hermes update`` is never re-adopted. The field must always be present
(``null`` off git) and must come from ``get_version_info().commit``.
