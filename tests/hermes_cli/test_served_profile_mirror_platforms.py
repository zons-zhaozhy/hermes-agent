"""A served secondary's api_server/webhook are MIRRORS of the default's listener (``/p/<profile>/...``),
never adapters of their own, so the multiplexer record has no ``<profile>:api_server`` entry. Every
status reader used to fall through to ``pending_restart``: the Desktop Messaging card and Command
Center read "Restart needed" forever for a platform that was answering. The mirror must project as the
default's live state plus the URL the client has to call; ``/api/status?profile=`` names the profiles a
restart of the shared gateway would blip.
