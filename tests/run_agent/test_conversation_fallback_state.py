def test_substantive_tool_only_turn_invalidates_older_housekeeping_fallback():
    """
    Regression test for #63860.

    A cached `_last_content_with_tools` response from a housekeeping-only turn
    must not survive a later substantive tool-only turn. When the model returns
    an empty response after the substantive tool turn, the system should enter
    the post-tool nudge path, not use the stale housekeeping fallback.

    Production impact: scheduled cron jobs could return early without
    completing their actual work (e.g., daily report job returning a
    housekeeping message instead of producing the report artifact).

    Test sequence:
    1. Content + todo (housekeeping) → sets fallback, marks as all-housekeeping
    2. Empty content + web_search (substantive) → should CLEAR old fallback
    3. Empty content, no tool calls → should enter post-tool nudge, not use old fallback
    4. Content "Recovered after nudge." → should be returned as final response

    Before the fix:
    - Step 2 would not clear the fallback state (no visible content)
    - Step 3 would incorrectly use the housekeeping fallback from step 1
    - API calls would stop at 3, never reaching the nudge response

    After the fix:
    - Step 2 classifies tools and clears the fallback because web_search is substantive
    - Step 3 enters the post-tool nudge path (no stale housekeeping fallback available)
    - Step 4 returns the nudge response as the final answer

def test_bare_tool_marker_is_not_reused_as_final_response():
    """
    Regression test for #78148.

    A provider/local template can emit a bare bracketed token (e.g. "[memory]")
    as assistant content alongside a tool call. That token is protocol
    scaffolding, not an answer. If it gets cached as `_last_content_with_tools`
    and the following turn is empty, the post-tool fallback replays it as the
    final response — and because it then enters the persisted transcript,
    later context compaction preserves it, letting the model repeat the
    marker in subsequent turns.

    Test sequence:
    1. Content "[memory]" + skill_manage (housekeeping) tool call → the bare
       marker must be discarded, not cached as a fallback.
    2. Empty content, no tool calls → enters the post-tool nudge path since
       no fallback is available.
    3. Content "Recovered after nudge." → returned as the final response.

    Before the fix:
    - Step 1 cached "[memory]" as `_last_content_with_tools`.
    - Step 2 reused it via the empty-response fallback, so the conversation
      never reached step 3 and "[memory]" leaked into the persisted history.

    After the fix:
    - Step 1 strips the bare marker before it is cached or persisted.
    - Step 2 has no fallback available and enters the nudge path instead.
    - Step 3 returns the nudge response as the final answer.
