"""Durable capture of a lost WAL generation (#105670 follow-up).

After ``DeletedWalGenerationError`` the retired frames survive only in an unlinked inode this process
keeps open, and the prescribed remediation ("stop the writers, then reopen") lets the kernel drop it.
These tests lose the sidecars for real and check that the exact generation is captured next to the
database at the first halt (or at ``close()``), located by inode rather than by pathname, and that a
transaction committed only in the retired WAL is recoverable from the capture alone, including after
the writer process has exited.
