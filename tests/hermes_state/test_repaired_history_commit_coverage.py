"""The alternation repair's provenance keeps compaction from archiving rows the compressor never held.

Another surface appends rows after this process loaded its prefix. The held history is repaired
(dropped tool rows, merged users, folded assistants) and reloaded without row ids, so the commit has
to name each held row from the repair's records. Falling back to the watermark, or matching by text,
archives those unseen rows: they leave the model's history without being in the summary. A carried
tail must not leave its originals summarized beside the live copy either.
