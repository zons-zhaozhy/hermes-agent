The iterative-update instruction, the emitted template, and ``_ground_historical_task_snapshot`` must agree on
one heading. A leftover ``## Active Task`` section is not disclaimed by SUMMARY_PREFIX and reads as live work,
so grounding must replace it (and any duplicate task section) rather than prepend a second one.
