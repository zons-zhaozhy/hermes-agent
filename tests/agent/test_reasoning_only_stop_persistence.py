"""Reasoning promoted on a reasoning-only clean stop is returned, never persisted as a reply.

A clean ``stop`` with empty content and reasoning text is promoted to ``final_response`` (the
vLLM nemotron parser files the whole answer as reasoning; re-running the empty-response ladder
re-bills the prompt). The promoted text must NOT become the assistant row's ordinary ``content``:
chain-of-thought stored as content is indistinguishable from a real reply on every history
surface (#111761). The row keeps ``content`` empty and carries the text as the ``api_content``
sidecar, so the next request still replays the answer byte-identically.
