"""One Desktop turn writes its user row and its tool rows into TWO sessions (#123545, evidence A + B).

``prompt.submit``'s durable user row is an OFF-turn write: it has only ``session["session_key"]``, because
the agent may not be built yet. The turn's own transcript is flushed under ``agent.session_id``. Those
two ids diverge for the whole of a turn that begins after the agent's session rotated: the compression
continuation, a lease-wait re-resolve, or an adopted tip all move ``agent.session_id`` while
``session_key`` is re-anchored only at turn end. Result: the user row lands in the parent, every tool
row and the final assistant text in the child, and the user reads one chat and sees part of the turn.

The regression test drives the REAL rotation (``publish_compression_child`` closes the parent and
mints the continuation) and asserts one turn's rows stay in ONE session.
