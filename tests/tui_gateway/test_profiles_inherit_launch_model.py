"""profiles.create inherits the launch profile's model together with the custom gateway backing it.

``_inherit_launch_model`` pins the launch ``model`` into the new profile through the same
validated path as ``/api/model/set``, and that validation runs inside the new profile's home. A
launch model on a custom ``providers:`` gateway is therefore only valid once the gateway
definition is already in the profile — writing it after the pin never ran (#101885 / #94071).
