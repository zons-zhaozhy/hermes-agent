"""Regression test: the stdio TUI entry point prewarms the /model picker cache.

The classic CLI run() loop calls ``prewarm_picker_cache_async()`` during the
idle window after the banner, so the first ``/model`` open hits a warm
provider-models disk cache. The stdio TUI entry point (``entry.main()``) never
did — the first ``/model`` open in a TUI session blocked on serial /v1/models
fetches for every authenticated provider (#72021).

These tests pin the entrypoint wiring itself (the helper's own worker/once
guard is covered in ``tests/hermes_cli/test_picker_prewarm.py``):

- ``main()`` invokes ``hermes_cli.model_switch_providers.prewarm_picker_cache_async``
  exactly once, AFTER the ``gateway.ready`` event is written (banner shown,
  user about to type — the idle window the prewarm is meant to fill).
- The startup path stays non-blocking: with the prewarm spied out, ``main()``
  proceeds into the stdin read loop and returns normally on EOF.
- A prewarm import/start failure is swallowed (fire-and-forget contract) and
  must not prevent ``main()`` from reaching the read loop.

Harness: same style as tests/test_tui_entry_mcp_owner.py — import
``tui_gateway.entry`` and monkeypatch its module attributes, running the real
``main()`` with stubbed I/O collaborators (no subprocess, no real gateway).
