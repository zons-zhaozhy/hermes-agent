"""Proxy-only egress: ``hermes update`` on a network whose ONLY way out is an HTTP(S) proxy.

Every command runs in its own network namespace (no route, no DNS; proven per module by
``_seed.assert_isolated``). The proxy is what a corporate network runs: it tunnels ``CONNECT``,
inspects TLS with the company's own root, may demand credentials, and refuses every host it has no
route for, logging it. The installed checkout was cloned from the official GitHub URL, so the
update's channel read (``hermes-assets.nousresearch.com``), its git fetch and every lazy blob
fetch of the partial clone (``github.com``) have to cross the proxy, and the cell reads the
proxy's log to show they did.

Failure classes: #124022 (updater dies with ``UNEXPECTED_EOF`` when direct TLS is cut and it
ignores the proxy), a proxy that requires auth, and a corporate root supplied via
``SSL_CERT_FILE`` instead of the OS store.
