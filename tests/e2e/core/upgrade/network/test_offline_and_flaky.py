"""Offline and flaky networks: fail fast, loud and truthfully, or retry within bounds.

Every command runs in a private network namespace. ``edge=None`` is a machine with no network
at all; otherwise the only egress is the test's proxy, whose sites script the failure: a release
host answering 503 with ``Retry-After``, a forge that rate-limits (HTTP 429), an artifact host
serving bytes that don't match the pinned digest.

The contract for a failure (``_seed.assert_nothing_changed``): non-zero exit, a message naming
what failed, no success banner, the checkout / selected PM environment / PM runtime / tool store
exactly as before, and the next ``hermes`` still starts. For a transient fault the contract is
that the operation retries within bounds and then succeeds.

Classes: offline update (channel and git phases) and offline PM provisioning; transient and
persistent 503 on the channel record; persistent 429 from the forge (#106026 printed the success
banner after a failed fetch); transient 503 then a digest mismatch on a PM download, for the
tools whose artifacts come from GitHub releases and from nodejs.org (#106027's class: a Node
tarball accepted without verification).
