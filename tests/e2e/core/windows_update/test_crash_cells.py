"""``hermes update`` killed mid-flight on native Windows, then the user's next launch.

Failure class: an update that never finishes. A user closes the console, Task Manager
ends the tree, the machine loses power. On Windows the kill is ``taskkill /T /F``:
no signal handler, no ``finally``, no atexit — exactly what these cells do to the
real process tree that ``hermes.exe update`` (or the Desktop's hand-off script
``scripts/desktop-update/windows.ps1``) started.

Each cell kills at one point of the update and then asserts what the user is owed:

* the next ``hermes`` launch runs a turn (the install is runnable);
* right after that launch the checkout IS the commit before the update or its target:
  HEAD is one of them and every tracked byte agrees with it (``git status`` clean,
  ``git diff --quiet HEAD``) — never a third, half-written tree. Each target edits
  modules every launch imports (``RUNTIME_FILES``), so a torn tree differs in code
  that runs, not only in a marker file;
* nothing the dead update left blocks the next one: a plain ``hermes update`` then
  completes to the target and no ``.hermes-update-in-progress`` marker survives it
  (a marker naming a dead process that refuses every later update is the permanent
  marker the hand-off contract forbids).

Cells (one machine; each publishes a fresh commit to update to; the ``mid_git`` cells run last;
a cell that leaves the machine unsound is that cell's verdict, and the harness resets the checkout
before the next cell starts, noted in the evidence: ``_run_cells``):

* ``mid_fetch``: killed while the update's ``git fetch`` child runs (nothing local moved yet);
* ``mid_git``: killed while the update's local git write (the fast-forward ``merge``, or a
  ``reset`` / ``checkout``) is inside the checkout with ``.git/index.lock`` held. The kill is
  deterministic: a smudge filter the harness names in the install's own ``.git/config`` and
  ``.git/info/attributes`` (git's filter hook, nothing in the product) holds git while it
  writes ``hermes_constants.py``, the last changed path in index order. At that moment git
  has written the cell's new file and ``hermes_cli/main.py`` and unlinked
  ``hermes_constants.py``: the torn tree, stale ``index.lock`` and missing startup module
  a mid-merge kill leaves;
* ``mid_git_bootstrap``: the same hold on ``hermes_bootstrap.py``, the first changed path in
  index order and the module every launcher imports to reach the repair: the kill leaves it
  unlinked, so the next launch must repair from the recovery code the update published outside
  the tree before git wrote;
* ``tree_moved``: killed right after the checkout moved to the target, before the
  update finished (dependency sync, launcher refresh, completion stamp);
* ``desktop_handoff``: the Desktop hand-off script's whole tree killed while its
  ``hermes update`` child runs;
* ``orphaned_update``: ONLY the hand-off script killed, once its ``hermes update`` child
  holds its place under the script's claim (that child keeps running: the shape of an
  ended PowerShell). The update must
  finish, ``.hermes-update-in-progress`` must read LIVE for as long as it runs (contract
  C1: the owner or its line-4 delegate is alive) and be gone once it exits.

Kill points are observed states, never timings: a git child of the update in the
process tree (by its argv), the held filter plus ``index.lock``, HEAD read straight from
the ref files, the hand-off's ``hermes update``
child past its lock acquisition (its banner in update.log) plus the claimed marker. Each waits with a bounded timeout and an update that
exits before its kill point is a harness verdict, never a pass.

The crash-cell matrix (cell -> file -> fixing lane) is in
website/docs/developer-guide/source-update-completion.md.
