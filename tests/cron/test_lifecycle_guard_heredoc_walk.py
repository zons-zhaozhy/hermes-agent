"""The referenced-script walk sees the same inert-heredoc-masked view as the direct scan (#110422).

``_direct_lifecycle_scan`` masks provably-inert heredoc bodies (quoted delimiter, allowlisted
data consumer such as ``python3 - <<'PY'``), but ``_contains_unsafe_gateway_action`` walked
referenced scripts and ``sh -c`` payloads on the raw command, so a >1 MiB data path mentioned
