"""Blocking gateway approval wait for :mod:`tools.approval`.

Mirrors the CLI's synchronous ``input()`` flow: the agent thread enqueues a
pending approval, the gateway notifies the user, and the thread blocks until
``/approve`` / ``/deny`` resolves it or the approval timeout elapses. Multiple
threads (parallel subagents, execute_code RPC handlers) can block concurrently
— each gets its own ``threading.Event``; ``/approve`` resolves the oldest,
``/approve all`` every pending entry. Queue state (``_gateway_queues``,
``_lock``) is owned by ``tools.approval`` and reached through that module at
call time.
