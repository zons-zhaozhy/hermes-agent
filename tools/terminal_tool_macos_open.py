"""macOS ``open`` frontmost raise-ladder for the terminal tool.

Split out of ``tools/terminal_tool.py`` (PR #95286, Jackal991): a pure,
deterministic string rewrite — no subprocess calls at transform time — that
appends a verified raise-ladder to file-opening ``open`` invocations so the
opened document lands in front of the Hermes window instead of behind it.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# macOS `open` frontmost raise-ladder
#
# On macOS, when the agent opens a file via a tool call (e.g. `open -a Preview
# file.pdf` or `open file.pdf`), the command returns exit 0 and genuinely
# succeeds — the document loads and a window is created — but the window opens
# BEHIND the Hermes desktop window (Hermes is typically maximised, so the file
# is completely hidden). Because the exit code is 0, the agent reports success
# while the user sees nothing happen.
#
# Root cause: the tool shell runs as a child process of the Electron app; macOS
# does not let a non-frontmost process hand activation to another app, so the
# implicit activation that normally accompanies `open` is silently ignored.
# `osascript -e 'tell application "X" to activate'` alone is NOT reliable (it
# also returns 0 while focus lands elsewhere, e.g. a racing Chrome).
#
# Fix: VERIFY, don't trust the exit code. After an `open`, check `frontmost`
# and escalate via a raise-ladder, then settle ~0.8s, re-check, and re-assert
# once. Each rung is verified before moving on; the report comes from the final
# observed state, never from "a rung returned 0".
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# be transformed (conservative: only transform when it clearly opens a file).
