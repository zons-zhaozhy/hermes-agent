"""Propagate agent-turn context into worker threads that dispatch Hermes tools.

A bare ``threading.Thread`` / ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` worker starts with an empty
``contextvars.Context`` and no thread-local approval/sudo callbacks, so tool dispatch inside it
silently loses the approval ContextVars (gateway sessions then auto-approve dangerous commands)
and the CLI callbacks (``prompt_dangerous_approval`` cannot reach the user, GHSA-qg5c-hvr5-hjgr).
Call :func:`propagate_context_to_thread` **on the parent thread** (it snapshots at call time) and
use the result as the worker target; callbacks are installed for the worker's lifetime and
always cleared on exit.
