"""Symlink-safe creation helpers for spill/cache files.

Spill files (oversized terminal output, hook context, subagent summaries,
web_extract full text) are written into predictable, world-discoverable
directories under ``~/.hermes``. A plain ``open(path, "w")`` /
``Path.write_text`` there follows a pre-planted symlink, letting any local
process that can write to the spill directory redirect our write onto an
arbitrary file owned by the user (``~/.bashrc``, ``authorized_keys``, ...).

Every helper here refuses symlinks by construction:

* New files are created with ``O_CREAT | O_EXCL``, which fails on ANY
  existing path — including a dangling symlink — instead of following it.
* Overwrites first remove the existing path via ``lstat`` + ``unlink``
  (deleting a link deletes the link, never its target), then re-create
  exclusively. The check-then-create pair cannot be raced into following a
  link because creation itself is exclusive.

Two privacy tiers:

* ``private=True`` (default) also forces ``0o700`` directories and
  ``0o600`` files — for spills that may hold raw, pre-redaction secrets
  (terminal output, hook context).
* ``private=False`` keeps umask-default permissions — for cache dirs that
  are bind-mounted into remote terminal backends (Docker/Modal/SSH via
  ``credential_files._CACHE_DIRS``), where a non-root container UID must
  still be able to read them (public web content, delegation summaries).

Disk failures are the caller's concern: helpers raise ``OSError`` and the
call sites keep their existing best-effort handling.
