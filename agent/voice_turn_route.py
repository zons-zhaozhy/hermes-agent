"""Per-turn model route for voice chat: ``auxiliary.voice_chat``.

A voice turn (CLI voice input, a Desktop/TUI voice conversation, a messaging voice note) can run
on a faster model than the session's main one. The route binds at the end of turn setup, after the
system prompt and session row were built for the main model and after preflight compression
judged the history against the main model's window, and is undone before post-turn work (memory
sync, background review) so nothing outside the turn sees it. A turn whose request would not fit
under the voice model's compression threshold at turn start runs on the main model instead, so
switching to voice never compacts the conversation to suit a smaller model.

Surfaces mark the next turn with ``agent._voice_turn_pending = True``; it is consumed here. GPT-Live
delegations are not voice turns in this sense: the live model already owns the voice layer and
delegates real work to the session's model.
