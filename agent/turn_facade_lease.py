"""Durable cross-process session turn lease for ``TurnFacadeMixin.run_conversation``.

One process at a time may load -> run -> flush a session shared through state.db (Desktop, CLI
resume, gateway, background delivery). ``admit_durable_turn_lease`` acquires the row lease (or
returns the early result the façade must hand back); ``DurableTurnLease`` owns the periodic
refresher, the turn-liveness watchdog wiring, and the lease-loss / stall interrupt plumbing. Both
