"""User-facing copy and ``failure_reason`` stamping for terminal failed-turn results.

Every terminal result dict the turn loop returns must carry ``failure_reason`` (a
``FailoverReason`` value or one of :data:`SITE_FAILURE_CODES`) and ``failure_retryable`` so
``agent/error_surface.py`` yields a specific descriptor instead of ``unknown``. The copy
tables here say WHAT happened and WHAT TO DO in plain words; raw provider detail rides a
trailing "Provider said:" / "Details:" line.
