"""The model-visible compression/elision marker and its matcher.

Tool-call arguments are no longer rewritten by the compressor, but legacy sessions may still
carry this marker inside replayed tool-call arguments. Dependency-free leaf shared by the
elision renderers (``agent.context_compressor``) and the dispatch-boundary detector
(``agent.tool_dispatch_helpers``), so the matcher is derived from the template instead of
re-typing its wording.
