"""Scripted prelude: tool calls a prompt built-in plays before the turn's first model call.

A prelude is a generator owned by the built-in (``agent.initiate_setup_prompt.initiate_setup_prelude``
is the one today). Each step it yields ``(content, tool_name, args)``: the assistant text and the one
tool call that row carries. The loop runs it through the unchanged ``run_tool_round`` (row persisted
before the tool runs, interim text and tool events emitted, tool hooks fired) and sends the tool's
result string back into the generator, so a later step can use an earlier answer.

It runs before any provider call, so the rows sit between this turn's user message and the first
model call: nothing cached is mutated, the system prompt is untouched, no user row is added, and
roles alternate ``user -> assistant(tool_calls) -> tool -> ... -> assistant(model)``. No API call is
counted and no ``pre/post_api_request`` hook fires for a step.
