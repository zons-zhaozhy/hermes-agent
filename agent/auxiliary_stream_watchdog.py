"""No-progress watchdog for streamed chat-completions auxiliary calls (#100501).

The consumer blocks inside the SDK's chunk iterator, so a silent stream is only noticed when the
httpx read timeout (the full auxiliary request budget, >= 300s for compression) expires; the host
compression wait gives up first and the attempt dies with no fallback. The window is enforced from a
Timer that only ``shutdown()``s this attempt's socket: that is FD-safe from a stranger thread
(#70773), wakes the owner's blocked read, and the owner still closes the stream in its ``finally``
so the pool drops the dead connection instead of recycling it.
