"""Post-loop turn finalization for ``run_conversation``.

Extracted from ``agent/conversation_loop.py`` as part of the god-file
decomposition campaign (``~/.hermes/plans/god-file-decomposition.md``, Phase 1
step 4 — the post-loop ``TurnFinalizer`` seam). ``run_conversation``'s tail
(everything after the main tool-calling ``while`` loop) is lifted here verbatim:
budget-exhaustion summary, trajectory save, session persist, turn diagnostics,
response transforms, result-dict assembly, steer drain, and the memory/skill
review trigger.

Behavior-neutral: the body is moved unchanged. All ``agent.*`` side effects fire
exactly as before; only the post-loop *locals* are passed in as keyword args, and
the assembled ``result`` dict is returned to ``run_conversation`` which returns it
to the caller. The function is synchronous with a single return — mirroring the
region it replaces (no awaits, no early returns).

Module ``logger`` is imported lazily inside the body (``from
agent.conversation_loop import logger``) so this module never imports
``agent.conversation_loop`` at import time -> no import cycle, and the log records
keep the exact logger name (``"agent.conversation_loop"``).
