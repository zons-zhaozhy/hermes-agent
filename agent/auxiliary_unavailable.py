"""Why an auxiliary client could not be built — and the Nous credential failure behind it.

``_resolve_nous_runtime_api`` must swallow the resolver's ``AuthError`` and return None so the
ladder can still fall back (stored token, fallback_chain). Swallowing it at DEBUG left the goal
loop reporting ``judge error: RuntimeError`` while the real cause was an ``invalid_grant`` refresh
(#42177). This module remembers the latest failure so the ladder's raise and the goal judge can
name it, and warns ONCE per distinct message so operators see it without debug logging.
