"""Native OpenAI Responses server-side compaction — gpt-5.6 on direct OpenAI routes only.

OpenAI's Responses API supports server-side compaction: include
``context_management=[{"type": "compaction", "compact_threshold": N}]`` in a
``/v1/responses`` request and, when the rendered input crosses N tokens, the
server summarizes older context into an opaque ``compaction`` output item
(``encrypted_content``, sealed to the issuing endpoint). Replaying that item
as an input item on later requests stands in for the pruned history, so the
model keeps long-horizon recall without the client ever seeing a summary.
Docs: https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/compaction

Hermes' support is deliberately narrow (live verification, Aug 2026):

* **gpt-5.6 family only.** gpt-5.6 and its variants compact correctly.
  Sending the field to gpt-5.1 / gpt-5.2 reliably fails server-side —
  HTTP 500 on the blocking path and a permanent stall on the streaming
  path (90s watchdog x 3 retries = a dead turn). There is no structured
  "unsupported" rejection to downgrade on, so the only safe gate is an
  explicit model-family check.
* **Direct OpenAI routes only:** api.openai.com (API key) or the ChatGPT
  Codex backend (subscription OAuth). Every other Responses surface
  (xAI, GitHub/Copilot, relays, local servers) never sees the field —
  most would 400 on the unknown parameter, and none can mint or decrypt
  the compaction blob.

Ownership model: Hermes' local compression stays fully armed as the
fallback owner. The native threshold is clamped safely below the local
compressor's trigger so the server compacts first; if it doesn't (native
disabled mid-session, provider hiccup, non-eligible route), the local
summarizer fires exactly as before. There is no new custody state — the
captured compaction items ride the existing ``codex_reasoning_items``
sidecar, which already handles persistence (state.db), gateway session
replay, cross-issuer stamping, and the encrypted-replay kill switch.

This module is dependency-free on purpose so the transport, adapter, and
conversation loop can share the gate without import cycles.
