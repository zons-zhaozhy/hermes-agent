# CLI Internals

Companion to `hermes_cli/AGENTS.md` (the rules) — this page holds the longer explanations.

## Update pipeline

User-facing behaviour (receipts, `--plan`, snapshot modes) is in
[Updating](../getting-started/updating.md); `hermes_cli/AGENTS.md` carries the short form of the rules.

Fleet-update campaign #91277 (Aug 2026). A PR that weakens a stage must answer for the failure class
it guards. `plan → snapshot → apply → restart-per-kind → verify → report`

- **Plan** (`update_inventory.py`, `hermes update --plan`): read-only inventory — install kind, all
  profiles, every live gateway with supervisor + running code version. Deployment kinds are
  first-class: `git` updates in place; `docker`/`nix`/`apt` are NOT in-place-updatable and the
  updater reports the correct external command instead of fighting the deployment model.
- **Snapshot** (`backup.py`): pre-update quick snapshot for EVERY profile (the code swap + fleet
  restart touch all of them), each into its own `state-snapshots/`, identical file set, 1 GiB
  per-file cap, keep=1. **Never add a partial/tiered snapshot set** — mixed coverage creates
  torn-restore states across schema generations. Quick snapshots are FILE-LOSS RECOVERY (the
  per-profile cron-jobs safety net restores from them), NOT code-rollback insurance; `--backup`
  full mode owns rollback.
- **Apply**: git pull, or the Windows ZIP fallback — which fires ONLY when git itself failed
  (`_should_zip_fallback_on_update_error`, argv-classified; a dependency-install failure must never
  trigger a tree-clobbering re-download), REFUSES a dirty working tree (`-uall` + a pre-swap TOCTOU
  re-check — but classifies a `!!` line by whether the swap would destroy it: an ignored path under a
  root entry the ZIP does not ship (`.bytecode-fingerprint`, `.hermes-bootstrap-complete`,
  `hermes_agent.egg-info/`; tracked root entries stand in for the ZIP set before the download, the
  re-check gets the real one), a nested `__pycache__`/`node_modules`, or a `_ZIP_PRESERVED_NESTED`
  output is admitted; other ignored files under shipped dirs still block), and grafts the live nested
  build outputs (`_ZIP_PRESERVED_NESTED`: `apps/desktop/{release,dist,node_modules,build}`,
  `hermes_cli/web_dist`, `ui-tui/{dist,node_modules,packages/hermes-ink/dist}`, `web/node_modules`,
  `scripts/whatsapp-bridge/node_modules`) into the staged swap by hardlink (the GitHub source ZIP has
  none of them; without the graft the swap deletes them). Post-swap, the Desktop
  rebuild decision also trusts the build stamp under HERMES_HOME, so an install that already lost
  its artifacts in an earlier update is rebuilt instead of "forgotten" (#90495).
- **Restart-per-kind**: systemd and launchd restarts are FLEET-WIDE within the updating install (every
  `hermes-gateway*` unit / `ai.hermes.gateway*` LaunchAgent whose home is the updating root or one of its
  `profiles/<name>`), drain-first (SIGUSR1), with per-unit/per-label failure isolation. Restarting only the
  invoking profile's service leaves siblings on stale `sys.modules` until they crash — the largest dupe-PR
  cluster in the repo's history came from that bug. The fleet is bounded by HOME, not by namespace:
  `hermes_cli/update_fleet_scope.py` judges every unit/label/process by the home it actually runs on
  (live environ, unit `Environment=`, plist `HERMES_HOME`), and a runtime of another `HERMES_HOME` on the
  same account — a sibling install, the real `hermes-gateway.service` seen from a scratch home — is named and
  left alone, never restarted (#93349).
- **Verify**: gateways stamp `code_sha`/`code_version` into `gateway_state.json` on every
  runtime-status write (`gateway/status.py`); the updater compares each live gateway against the
  fresh checkout and prints a fleet version matrix. A provably-stale gateway fails the update
  (exit 1) — automation must never treat a mixed-version fleet as healthy.
- **Report**: every run writes a machine-readable receipt to `~/.hermes/logs/update_receipts/`
  (`latest.json` pointer; steps, skips WITH reasons, restart outcome, plan, fleet snapshot).
  Before a source swap, the parent captures plan/snapshots/receipt and its Windows pause token.
  `update_completion.py` runs new-code PM preparation with site initialization disabled, then
  selected-Python builds, maintenance, scans/restarts and verification. Git/current/ZIP share
  this owner; never reload or purge modules to continue in the old interpreter. The parent keeps
  the lock, waits, and accepts only a correlated terminal result. `cmd_update` still finalizes
  early failures and missing/killed-child outcomes; PM refusal data survives the handoff.
  See `website/docs/developer-guide/source-update-completion.md`. A begun-but-unwritten receipt is a bug.
- **Nothing runs pulled code in the pre-pull interpreter.** This tree finishes updates through
  `update_completion.run_completion` / `_update_takeover.py`.
  `hermes_cli/update_handoff.py` and `hermes_cli/update_serve_obligations.py` are the
  FROZEN COMPAT SURFACE for releases that lazily import those module
  names from the NEW tree after the checkout swap.
  Keep their public names importable and behavior-preserving. They call into
  `_old_updater.stop_for_relaunch` → `_run_child`. Removing a name
  bricks every release mid-update. see `tests/compat/old_updater_surface.json`.

Process-scan coordination between updater, serve/dashboard, and gateway is being replaced by a
gateway-owned control socket (#92091); scans are the fallback layer for old/crashed processes — read
#92091 before adding any heuristic. Process identity rules (never argv substrings; canonical
matchers; parser-derived flag sets; never blanket-exclude gateway ancestors, #87594): root
`AGENTS.md` and `website/docs/developer-guide/cli-internals.md`.

The systemd blunt-restart fallback waits for the unit's `TimeoutStopUSec` plus
`TimeoutStartUSec`, with 15 seconds of client-side slack. It reads the target unit
in the same manager scope as the restart; both the initial attempt and retry use
this budget, including the catch-up restart after an interrupted update.
A start after a graceful drain uses only the start budget plus slack.
A missing, unparseable, or infinite phase limit falls back to 90 seconds
for that phase, keeping unattended updates bounded. Timing out the `systemctl`
client does **not** cancel the manager's transaction. Custom multi-command stop
chains or `EXTEND_TIMEOUT_USEC` can still outlast this estimate; a real timeout
remains an incomplete restart, and successful commands still require the existing
service-health and fleet-version verification. Raw numeric `*USec` values are
microseconds, while formatted values use systemd's fixed units, including days,
weeks, months and years. The combined timeout is capped below the native signed
32-bit millisecond poll limit (with rounding headroom), so exceptionally long
unit limits cannot overflow subprocess polling. Zero/unknown/infinite phase
limits use the bounded fallback. This does not change active-turn drain settings.

## Nous free tier sign-in

Sign-in completion is one function, `settle_after_upgrade`, called by every caller that persists an
account over a free-tier identity (CLI `upgrade_guest`, the desktop poller): it moves a config on the
welcome route to the account's host and the tier's recommended default
(`models.recommended_nous_default_model`, shared with `GET /api/model/recommended-default`).

The shared flow, states, and copy live in `anon_sign_in.py`; CLI rendering lives in
`anon_sign_in_cli.py`. `anon_auth.py` keeps identity, promotion polling, and settlement, and
re-exports the existing sign-in API. The flow resolves identity and persistence collaborators
through `anon_auth` at call time to preserve module-attribute monkeypatch seams.

The sign-in itself is one composition: `anon_auth.run_sign_in()` yields `SignInState`s (`Code`,
`Waiting`, `Completed`, `Declined`, `Superseded`, `TimedOut`, `Retired`, `Failed`,
`AlreadySignedIn`, `Unavailable`). It reads the current state itself, holds one absolute deadline
across both waits, persists only after a completed promotion **and** a token grant, runs
`settle_after_upgrade` exactly once per completion, and never lets a persist or settle failure
escape as an exception — it becomes `Failed`. Every state carries its own `.copy` (the chat form,
which never contains a raw exception, a URL or a `hermes` verb) and `.copy_terminal`, so no caller
maps a reason to a string. `cancelled()` stops an attempt; `cancel_wins_after_promotion` decides
what happens when the server had already completed the transfer — the desktop keeps `True` (a
DELETE means "not on this machine"), the gateway passes `False` (a supersede must not discard a
transfer the user actually approved). `scope` is entered only around the precondition and persist
blocks, never across a `yield` or a network wait, because `run_in_executor` does not carry
contextvars. `upgrade_guest` (`hermes auth upgrade`), the CLI `/login` handler and the desktop
promotion poller are renderers over it; a surface that needs the cancel check and the save to be
atomic passes `persist_guard`. The desktop's plain "connect another Nous account" device-code login
is a separate path (`_nous_plain_poller`) and must stay one.

## Process identity: never infer it from argv substrings

The bug class behind ~10 fleet-update issues (#90778, #87594, #78089, #76129, #91964, ...):
classifying a process by `"serve" in cmdline` or similar. `kanban --preserve-cache` contains
"serve"; a flag VALUE can equal a subcommand (`-m dashboard serve`); truncated cmdlines hide the real
subcommand. Rules:

- Use the canonical matchers: `gateway.status.looks_like_gateway_command_line` (gateway run),
  `hermes_cli.update_cmd._hermes_holder_subcommand` (top-level subcommand of any Hermes argv). Never
  hand-roll token scans.
- Flag sets must be DERIVED from the parser (`_holder_value_flags()` introspects
  `build_top_level_parser()`), never hand-written lists — they drift.
- Never blanket-exclude ancestors from process scans: when `/update` runs as the gateway's child, a
  gateway ancestor must stay visible to the pause machinery (#87594). Exclude interactive ancestry,
  carve out gateway-shaped ancestors.
- Match on FULL cmdlines; truncate only at display time (#78089).
- Before adding any new scan heuristic, read #92091 — the gateway control socket replaces scans as
  the primary coordination mechanism; scans are the fallback layer for old/crashed processes.

## Skin engine — what skins customize

| Element | Skin key | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| Banner panel border / title / section headers / dim / body | `colors.banner_border`, `banner_title`, `banner_accent`, `banner_dim`, `banner_text` | `banner.py` |
| Response box border | `colors.response_border` | `cli.py` |
| Spinner faces (waiting / thinking) | `spinner.waiting_faces`, `spinner.thinking_faces` | `display.py` |
| Spinner verbs / wings (optional) | `spinner.thinking_verbs`, `spinner.wings` | `display.py` |
| Tool output prefix / per-tool emojis | `tool_prefix`, `tool_emojis` | `display.py` → `get_tool_emoji()` |
| Agent name / welcome / response label / prompt symbol | `branding.agent_name`, `welcome`, `response_label`, `prompt_symbol` | `banner.py`, `cli.py` |

Built-in skins (`_BUILTIN_SKINS` in `hermes_cli/skin_engine.py`): `default` (classic gold/kawaii),
`ares` (crimson/bronze with custom spinner wings), `mono` (grayscale), `slate` (cool blue). Add a
built-in as a dict entry `{"name", "description", "colors", "spinner", "branding", "tool_prefix"}`.
User skins are `~/.hermes/skins/<name>.yaml` with the same keys, activated with `/skin <name>` or
`display.skin: <name>`; the full YAML template is in the
[Skins & Themes](../user-guide/features/skins.md) user guide.

## Profiles: multi-instance support

Hermes supports profiles — fully isolated instances, each with its own `HERMES_HOME` (config, API
keys, memory, sessions, skills, gateway). For single-profile commands (`hermes -p x <cmd>`),
`_apply_profile_override()` in `hermes_cli/main.py` sets `HERMES_HOME` before any module imports, so
every `get_hermes_home()` reference scopes to the active profile. The multiplex gateway and the
Desktop/dashboard `serve` backend serve several profiles from one process instead: the active
profile is a contextvar override bound per activity, `os.environ["HERMES_HOME"]` stays the launch
profile's, and a module-level constant derived from the home freezes to that launch profile (see
[Gateway Internals § Multiplexed profiles](./gateway-internals.md#multiplexed-profiles)). Profile
operations are HOME-anchored (`_get_profiles_root()` returns
`Path.home() / ".hermes" / "profiles"`, not `get_hermes_home() / "profiles"`) so
`hermes -p coder profile list` sees all profiles regardless of which one is active — intentional.
Profile-safe coding rules are in the root `AGENTS.md`; multiplex secret-scope rules in
`gateway/AGENTS.md`.
