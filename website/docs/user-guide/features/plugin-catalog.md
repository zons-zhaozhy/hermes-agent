# Plugin Catalog

The plugin catalog is a curated, human-reviewed directory of Hermes plugins you
can install by name with a single command:

```bash
hermes plugins install <name>
```

Browse it visually at **[/docs/plugins](/plugins)** — entries are shelved by
category (Memory, Desktop, Platforms, Web & Browser, Tools, Voice, Automation,
Models), with search, tier filters (Official / Community), capability chips, and
**Install in Hermes** buttons and copyable CLI commands for every entry.

In Desktop, open **Capabilities → Plugins → Browse** for the native catalog
view. It is not an embedded website. **Installed** is a separate tab backed
by the app's desktop-plugin registry and the selected profile's agent-plugin
state, rather than catalog metadata. Skills uses the same **Installed / Browse**
layout; search stays at the top and the tab switch and actions share one row.

The catalog complements — it does not replace — the existing
[plugin system](plugins.md). Anything you can install from the catalog is a
normal plugin under the hood; the catalog just adds discovery and a review
layer on top.

### Published browse data

The website and Desktop read the same generated CDN snapshot:
[`https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/api/plugins.json`](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/api/plugins.json).
Desktop fetches it through
`https://nousresearch.github.io/hermes-agent/docs/api/plugins.json`; the public
docs alias serves the same data. The docs build reads `plugin-catalog/*.yaml`
and adds cached repository star counts. It also publishes the installer's
removed-entry list. Neither
Browse view crawls source repositories or queries the GitHub API live.

This browse snapshot is distinct from the installer's
[`plugin-catalog.json`](#live-refresh), which resolves catalog names and pins.

## What's in an entry

Each catalog entry is a small YAML file in the
[`plugin-catalog/`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/tree/main/plugin-catalog)
directory of the hermes-agent repository, declaring:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `name` | The catalog key you pass to `hermes plugins install` |
| `repo` | The plugin's public git repository |
| `sha` | The **exact 40-hex commit** that was reviewed — installs check out this pin, not a branch tip |
| `tier` | `official` (maintained by NousResearch) or `community` |
| `category` | Browse shelf: `desktop` (default), `memory`, `platform`, `web`, `tools`, `voice`, `automation`, `models` or `general` |
| `maintainer` | Who owns the plugin |
| `capabilities` | Declared tools, hooks, middleware, and required env vars |
| `requires_hermes` | Minimum Hermes version, e.g. `>=0.19` (optional) |
| `platforms` | OS restrictions, empty = all (optional) |
| `docs_url` | External documentation link (optional) |

## Trust model

The catalog is designed so you know exactly what you're installing:

- **Human-merged admission.** Every entry (and every pin update) lands via a
  pull request reviewed by a maintainer. Nothing enters the catalog
  automatically.
- **Exact SHA pins.** Entries pin a specific commit, not a branch. A plugin
  author pushing new code to their repo does **not** change what the catalog
  installs — updating the pin requires another reviewed PR.
- **Capability declarations.** Entries state up front which tools, hooks, and
  middleware the plugin provides and which environment variables (API keys
  etc.) it needs, so you can judge its blast radius before installing.
- **Removed list.** Plugins pulled from the catalog (for example after a
  security incident) go on `plugin-catalog/removed.yaml` with a reason and
  date. The installer refuses to install anything on the removed list.
- **Installed ≠ enabled.** Installing a catalog plugin puts it on disk; like
  any plugin it must still be enabled before it loads. See
  [Plugins → Enabling and disabling](plugins.md).

:::warning Catalog review is a point-in-time review
A catalog entry means the pinned commit was looked at by a human, capability
declarations were checked, and the repo met the submission bar. It is not a
security audit, and it says nothing about other commits in the same
repository. Review the code of anything you give credentials to.

## Installing from the catalog

On the website, **Install in Hermes** opens a protocol link of this form:

```text
hermes://plugin/install?repo=owner%2Frepo&catalog_name=example-plugin&sha=0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
```

`repo` is URL-encoded, including any `#subdir`. Desktop asks you to review the
source, destination and components before confirming; the link does not
auto-install. For the agent-plugin component, the backend resolves
`catalog_name` to its reviewed pin. The link's `sha` is **display metadata
only**, not authority to choose or override a commit, and it is not a pin
guarantee for a standalone desktop plugin.

Use an updated Desktop build for the catalog parameters (and for the public
Skills Hub's new `hermes://skill/install?identifier=...` route). Older builds
may only understand repository-only plugin links. The expanded cards retain
CLI commands, so you can install by catalog name without Desktop:

```bash
# Install a reviewed catalog entry by name (checks out the pinned SHA)
hermes plugins install <name>

# Then enable it, as with any plugin
hermes plugins enable <name>
```

The install prompt shows the entry's capability summary — declared tools,
hooks, and required env vars — before anything is cloned.

The catalog name and the plugin's own manifest name can differ; `hermes
plugins install` prints the installed name, and `enable` takes that one. For
example the `touchdesigner` entry (a portable Agent Plugins v1 package that
bundles the twozero MCP server with the `touchdesigner-mcp` skill) installs as
`td`, kept short so its generated MCP tool names stay under provider
function-name limits:

```bash
hermes plugins install touchdesigner
hermes plugins enable td
```

Portable packages can also carry a stdio MCP server. The `snyk` entry pins the
Snyk CLI (`npx -y snyk@<version> mcp`) and bundles the `snyk-security-scan`
skill, so one install gives Hermes code, dependency, container and IaC scanning
plus the workflow for using it; the catalog name and manifest name match:

```bash
hermes plugins install snyk
hermes plugins enable snyk
```

### Updating a catalog install

`hermes plugins update <name>` never runs `git pull` for catalog installs —
it compares your installed pin against the current catalog pin and, when the
catalog moved (via a reviewed PR), force-reinstalls at the new SHA. Your
enabled/disabled state is preserved. `hermes plugins list` shows catalog
installs as `catalog:<tier>@<sha>` so you can see provenance at a glance.

### Names not in the catalog

A bare name that isn't a catalog entry is an error: there is no second,
unreviewed name index. Install such plugins by `owner/repo` or Git URL instead
(custom source, see below), or submit them to the catalog.

### Live refresh

The docs build publishes the catalog as one JSON document
(`https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/api/plugin-catalog.json`).
`search`/`install`/`update` fetch it at most every six hours and cache it under
`~/.hermes/cache/`, so new entries and removals reach installed clients without
updating Hermes. Offline, the copy shipped with your checkout is used. Removals
from the in-tree list and the live list are always both enforced.

### Custom git URLs are different

`hermes plugins install <git-url>` still works for any repository, but it
bypasses the catalog entirely:

- **No review** — you get whatever is at the branch tip, not a reviewed pin.
- **A warning banner** is shown to make clear the code is unvetted.
- The removed list is still consulted (a known-bad repo is refused by URL).

Use the git-URL path for your own plugins and repos you already trust; use the
catalog for discovery.

## Submitting a plugin to the catalog

Submissions are pull requests that add one `plugin-catalog/<name>.yaml` file.
The full checklist lives in the
[plugin-catalog README](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/tree/main/plugin-catalog);
in short, an entry must be:

1. **Owner-submitted** — the PR author owns or maintains the plugin repo.
   Maintainers also add batches of community plugins from a reviewed sweep
   (each pin validated and scanned at the pinned commit); if yours was swept
   in and you want it changed or removed, open a PR on your entry.
2. **A public repository** — the `repo` URL is publicly cloneable.
3. **Released** — the repo has real releases/tags, not just a default branch.
4. **Passing validation** — the catalog validation GitHub Action is green on
   the PR (schema, SHA format, reachability).
5. **Not self-updating** — the catalog build must not download and replace
   its own files; the pinned SHA is the only update path (a SHA-bump PR plus
   `hermes plugins update <name>`).

Pin updates (bumping `sha` to a newer commit) follow the same PR + review
process.
