# Language Server Protocol (LSP)

Hermes runs full language servers — pyright, gopls, rust-analyzer,
typescript-language-server, clangd, and ~20 more — as background
subprocesses and feeds their semantic diagnostics into the post-write
lint check used by `write_file` and `patch`. When the agent edits a
file, it sees exactly the errors that edit introduced — not just
syntax errors, but **type errors, undefined names, missing imports,
and project-wide semantic issues** the language server detects.

This is the same architecture top-tier coding agents use. Hermes
ships it self-contained: no editor host required, no plugins to
install, no separate daemon to manage.

## When LSP runs

LSP is gated on **git workspace detection**. When the agent's working
directory (or the file being edited) is inside a git repository, LSP
runs against that workspace. When neither is in a git repo, LSP
stays dormant — useful for messaging gateways where the cwd is the
user's home directory and there's no project to diagnose.

The check is layered: in-process syntax check first (microseconds),
then LSP diagnostics second when syntax is clean. A flaky or missing
language server can never break a write — every LSP failure path
falls back silently to the syntax-only result.

Concretely, on every successful `write_file` or `patch`:

1. Hermes captures a baseline of current diagnostics for the file.
2. Performs the write.
3. Re-queries the language server, filters out diagnostics that were
   already in the baseline, and surfaces only the new ones.

The agent sees output like:

```
{
  "bytes_written": 42,
  "dirs_created": false,
  "lint": {"status": "ok", "output": ""},
  "lsp_diagnostics": "LSP diagnostics introduced by this edit:\n<diagnostics file=\"/path/to/foo.py\">\nERROR [42:5] Cannot find name 'foo' [reportUndefinedVariable] (Pyright)\nERROR [50:1] Argument of type \"str\" is not assignable to \"int\" [reportArgumentType] (Pyright)\n</diagnostics>"
}
```

The `lint` field carries the syntax-check result (microsecond
in-process parse via `ast.parse`, `json.loads`, etc.); the
`lsp_diagnostics` field carries the semantic diagnostics from the
real language server. Two channels, independent signals — the
agent sees a syntax-clean file with semantic problems as
``lint: ok`` plus a populated ``lsp_diagnostics``.

### Workspace trust

Many language servers run code that the project itself ships:
pyright executes the configured Python interpreter,
typescript-language-server loads the project's
`node_modules/typescript`, svelte-language-server loads
`svelte.config.js`, rust-analyzer runs `cargo check` (build scripts,
proc-macros) on every save, and servers such as jdtls,
kotlin-language-server, elixir-ls, zls or haskell-language-server
evaluate the project's build files (Gradle, `mix.exs`, `build.zig`,
Cabal/Stack) when they start. That is fine for your own project, but
not for a repository the agent has just cloned.

Hermes therefore treats every workspace as untrusted unless it is:

- the git worktree of a directory you pointed Hermes at: where you
  launched it (`cd my-app && hermes`), the worktree `hermes -w`
  created, the project a Desktop or TUI session is opened in, or a
  gateway's `terminal.cwd`, or
- a directory listed under `lsp.trusted_workspaces` (or any
  directory below one).

A `cd` in the agent's terminal does not move the session's workspace.
Cron jobs and Kanban workers get no automatic trust, because the agent
can choose their workdir or workspace; list the directories they should
trust under `lsp.trusted_workspaces`. A checkout nested inside a trusted
worktree has its own `.git`, so it is not trusted, and neither is a git
repository at or above your home directory (a dotfiles repo there would
otherwise trust everything below it). Trust covers the whole directory
you pointed Hermes at, including anything later cloned into it, and
lasts until Hermes exits.

In an untrusted workspace Hermes **denies by default**: only the
servers below start, each with settings that keep it on Hermes-side
tools. Every other server is skipped, including rust-analyzer, gopls,
jdtls, kotlin-language-server, elixir-ls, zls, clojure-lsp,
haskell-language-server, lua-language-server, terraform-ls, prisma,
astro, vue-language-server (it loads the `vueCompilerOptions.plugins`
a project's `tsconfig.json` names) and any server you declare under `lsp.servers`. The diagnostics
log records `skipped: untrusted workspace …; add it to
lsp.trusted_workspaces`, and `hermes lsp status` marks those servers
`[trusted workspaces only]`.

| Server | Untrusted workspace |
|---|---|
| pyright | `VIRTUAL_ENV` or the Hermes-managed Python, never the project's `.venv`/`venv` |
| typescript-language-server | `tsserver.path` pinned to the TypeScript next to the server; skipped if there is none |
| svelte-language-server | `isTrusted: false` (no `svelte.config.js`, no project `svelte`/`prettier`) |
| bash-language-server, yaml-language-server, dockerfile-ls, intelephense | unchanged: they run no project code (yaml-language-server may fetch the JSON schemas a file names) |
| clangd | unchanged: Hermes never passes `--query-driver`, so no project compiler runs |

On a local backend, the post-write shell linters that would use the
checkout's own toolchain are skipped the same way whenever the terminal's
current directory is untrusted: `npx tsc` (it runs
the repository's `node_modules/.bin/tsc`, or installs from the
registry its `.npmrc` names) and `rustfmt --check` (rustup honours the
repository's `rust-toolchain.toml`). Sandboxed backends (Docker, SSH,
Modal, …) are unchanged.

Diagnostics that need the project's dependencies (for example
unresolved-import warnings) may be less precise until you trust the
workspace.

```yaml
lsp:
  trusted_workspaces:
    - ~/code/my-app
```

For "manual" entries, install the server through whatever toolchain
manager makes sense for that language (rustup, ghcup, opam, brew,
…). Hermes auto-detects the binary on PATH or in
`<HERMES_HOME>/lsp/bin/`.

### PowerShell

PowerShellEditorServices isn't a single binary — it's a PowerShell
module bundle launched by a `pwsh` (PowerShell 7+) or `powershell`
host. Setup:

1. Install [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) so
   `pwsh` (or Windows `powershell`) is on PATH.
2. Download the latest release zip from
   [PowerShellEditorServices releases](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/releases)
   and extract it.
3. Point Hermes at the extracted bundle — the directory that contains
   `PowerShellEditorServices/Start-EditorServices.ps1`. Either:
   - set `lsp.servers.powershell.command: ["/path/to/bundle"]` in
     `config.yaml`, or
   - extract it to `<HERMES_HOME>/lsp/PowerShellEditorServices`, or
   - export `PSES_BUNDLE_PATH=/path/to/bundle`.

`hermes lsp status` reports `installed` once `pwsh` is found; if the
bundle is missing you'll see a one-time warning in the logs with the
download link.

### Laravel Blade

`.blade.php` templates go to [laravel-lsp](https://github.com/laravel/lsp)
(Blade, Eloquent, Facades) while plain `.php` files stay with
intelephense. Install it once with Composer and make sure the binary
is on PATH (or pin it with `lsp.servers.laravel-lsp.command`):

```bash
composer global require laravel/lsp
export PATH="$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"
```

Hermes launches it as `laravel-lsp lsp` (stdio). There is no
auto-install recipe; `hermes lsp status` shows `manual-only` until the
binary is found.

A few servers are installed alongside a peer dependency that npm
won't auto-pull. `typescript-language-server` and `@vue/language-server`
require the `typescript` SDK importable from the same `node_modules`
tree — Hermes installs `typescript@6` (the last JavaScript-based line;
TypeScript 7 is the Go port and ships no `tsserver.js`) together with
the server when you run `hermes lsp install typescript` /
`hermes lsp install vue-language-server` or auto-install fires on first use.

Vue is pinned to `@vue/language-server@2`, started with
`vue.hybridMode: false` so it hosts its own TypeScript service. The 3.x
line only works behind a client-hosted `tsserver` tunnel (the VS Code /
Neovim setup) that Hermes's generic client does not run, so it never
publishes diagnostics. If an earlier Hermes installed 3.x, the log shows a
one-time `vue-language-server: ... 3.x` warning; delete
`<HERMES_HOME>/lsp/node_modules/@vue` and `<HERMES_HOME>/lsp/bin/vue-language-server*`,
then run `hermes lsp install vue-language-server` (the recipe co-installs the
TypeScript SDK).

## CLI

```
hermes lsp status          # service state + per-server install status
hermes lsp list            # registry, optionally --installed-only
hermes lsp install <id>    # eagerly install one server
hermes lsp install-all     # try every server with a known recipe
hermes lsp restart         # tear down running clients
hermes lsp which <id>      # print resolved binary path
```

`hermes lsp status` is the best starting point — it shows which
languages will get semantic diagnostics today and which need a
binary installed.

## Configuration

The defaults work for typical setups; nothing to set if the binaries
are on PATH.

```yaml
# config.yaml
lsp:
  # Master toggle. Disabling skips the entire subsystem — no servers
  # spawn, no background event loop runs.
  enabled: true

  # How long to wait for diagnostics after each write.
  wait_mode: document      # "document" or "full"
  # Max seconds to wait for the server on each of the two waits an
  # edit makes: the pre-edit baseline snapshot and the post-edit
  # re-check. Only *fresh* diagnostics (produced for the post-edit
  # content) are ever reported; if the server doesn't finish within
  # this budget, the edit reports "no LSP data" rather than stale
  # errors from before the edit. Raise this for slow servers on big
  # projects (tsserver, rust-analyzer mid-indexing).
  wait_timeout: 5.0

  # Budget for the FIRST request against a workspace whose server is
  # not running yet — spawn, initialize and the server's initial program
  # build all happen inside it (tsserver on a 10k-file project can need
  # a minute). Once the client is up, wait_timeout applies again.
  # 0 = no extra grace (same as wait_timeout).
  warmup_timeout: 0

  # After a server fails for a workspace (spawn error, or the request
  # outran its budget) that (server, root) pair is skipped. 0 = for the
  # rest of the process (until `hermes lsp restart`); N = retried after
  # N seconds, so one transient stall does not silence a workspace
  # forever. Skips are logged once per root at INFO with the retry time.
  broken_retry_seconds: 0

  # Workspace roots where no language server runs at all — glob
  # patterns matched against the resolved project root (~ expanded; a
  # bare path also matches everything beneath it). Use it for the one
  # huge monorepo whose server cannot finish in budget while every other
  # workspace keeps its diagnostics — unlike servers.<id>.disabled,
  # which switches the server off everywhere. Must be a list; any other
  # shape logs a warning and skips LSP for every workspace until fixed.
  exclude_roots: []
  # exclude_roots: ["~/work/huge-monorepo", "/srv/checkouts/*/vendor"]

  # Directories whose projects a language server may load code from
  # (see "Workspace trust" above). ~ expanded; everything under an

  # using npm, so a pnpm/yarn supply-chain policy (minimumReleaseAge,
  # allowBuilds, …) is never bypassed. Yarn Berry (2+): its default PnP
  # linker writes no node_modules/.bin, so set `nodeLinker: node-modules`
  # in <HERMES_HOME>/lsp/.yarnrc.yml. pnpm 11 blocks git-hosted transitive
  # deps by default (ERR_PNPM_EXOTIC_SUBDEP); @vue/language-server 2.x pulls
  # one in, so under pnpm that server is skipped with the pnpm error in the

  servers:
    pyright:
      disabled: false
      command: ["/abs/path/to/pyright-langserver", "--stdio"]
      env: { PYRIGHT_LOG_LEVEL: "info" }
      initialization_options:

            typeCheckingMode: "strict"
    typescript:

```

### Per-server keys

* `disabled: true` — skip this server entirely even when its
  extensions match a file.
* `command: [bin, ...args]` — pin a custom binary path. Bypasses
  auto-install.
* `env: {KEY: value}` — extra env vars passed to the spawned process.
  Servers and the npm / `go install` auto-installers start from Hermes'
  scrubbed child environment (no gateway tokens or provider API keys),
  so a server that needs one of those gets it only through this key.
* `initialization_options: {...}` — merged into the LSP
  `initializationOptions` payload sent in the `initialize`
  handshake. Server-specific; consult the language server's docs.

### Custom servers

Any `lsp.servers` key that is **not** a built-in server id declares
your own language server. It needs `command` and `extensions`; the
other keys are optional. Custom servers are matched *before* the
built-ins, so they can also take over an extension Hermes already
handles.

```yaml
lsp:
  servers:
    panache:
      command: ["panache-lsp", "--stdio"]   # PATH lookup or an absolute/~ path
      extensions: [".pnch"]                 # or basenames like "Justfile"
      root_markers: ["panache.toml"]        # nearest dir with one of these; default: workspace root
      language_id: "panache"                # didOpen languageId; default: derived from the extension
      description: "Panache markdown"
      env: { PANACHE_LOG: "warn" }          # same optional keys as built-ins
      initialization_options: {}
```

Custom servers are never auto-installed: put the binary on PATH (or
give an absolute path) and `hermes lsp status` lists it as
`installed`. A malformed entry is logged and skipped without
affecting the other servers.

## Installation locations

When `install_strategy: auto`, Hermes installs binaries into
`<HERMES_HOME>/lsp/bin/`. NPM packages land in
`<HERMES_HOME>/lsp/node_modules/` with bin symlinks one level up.
Go binaries come from `go install` with `GOBIN` pointed at the
staging dir.

Nothing is ever installed to `/usr/local/`, `~/.local/`, or any other
shared location — the staging dir is fully Hermes-owned and is
removed when you reset the profile.

## Performance characteristics

LSP servers are **lazy-spawned** on first use. Editing a Python file
in a project that's never seen `.py` traffic spawns pyright; the
spawn takes 1-3 seconds for most servers (rust-analyzer can take 10+
on a cold project). Subsequent edits in the same workspace re-use
the running server.

The LSP layer adds a few milliseconds to clean writes when no
diagnostics are emitted. When diagnostics are emitted, the wait
budget is `wait_timeout` seconds — typically the server responds in
tens of milliseconds for pyright/tsserver and a few seconds for
rust-analyzer mid-indexing. Each edit waits twice (a pre-edit
baseline snapshot for the delta, then the post-edit re-check), so a
server that never answers costs at most `2 × wait_timeout` per edit.
The very first request against a workspace also pays the spawn and the
server's initial program build; give large projects room with
`lsp.warmup_timeout` (only that first, cold request uses it — the
steady-state budget is unchanged) rather than raising `wait_timeout`,
which would let every later edit block for the cold-build duration.

A server that fails for a workspace — spawn error, or a request that
outran its budget — marks that `(server, root)` pair broken and every
later request for it is skipped (logged once per root at INFO). By
default the pair stays broken until `hermes lsp restart` or process
exit; `lsp.broken_retry_seconds: N` retries it after N seconds so one
transient stall does not cost the workspace its diagnostics for good.
A root you never want served — one monorepo whose server cannot finish
in any budget — goes in `lsp.exclude_roots`; other workspaces keep
their servers.

Diagnostics are **freshness-gated**: a result only counts when the
server produced it for the content of the current edit (a
`publishDiagnostics` push at/after the change, or a pull request
answered after it). Slow servers that haven't re-checked yet result
in "no data" for that edit — never in yesterday's errors being
re-reported as current.

Servers are kept alive while they're being used and shut down after
`lsp.idle_timeout` seconds (default 600) with no file activity — a
long-running gateway that touches many worktrees no longer accumulates
one language-server process per workspace forever. A reaped server is
respawned automatically on the next relevant file operation. Set
`idle_timeout: 0` to disable reaping and hold every server's index warm
for the life of the process.

Servers are also released when their workspace goes away, even if they
are not idle: removing a Hermes-managed worktree (`hermes -w` session
end, Kanban task cleanup, a delegated subagent's pruned worktree) shuts
down that tree's language servers before `git worktree remove` runs, and
the periodic sweep shuts down any server whose project root no longer
exists on disk (deleted outside Hermes). The sweep is part of the idle
reaper, so `idle_timeout: 0` also disables deleted-root reaping; the
worktree-removal release always runs. A multi-root server only drops the
vanished folder and keeps serving its sibling roots.

Servers that support multi-root workspaces (currently pyright) run as a
**single process** per Hermes process: the first Python project spawns
it, and every further project root — for example sibling git worktrees
edited by parallel subagents — is attached to that same server as an
additional workspace folder instead of starting another copy.

## Disabling

Set `lsp.enabled: false` in `config.yaml` to disable the entire
subsystem. The post-write check falls back to the in-process syntax
check (`ast.parse` for Python, `json.loads` for JSON, etc.) which
ships unchanged from earlier versions.

To disable a single language without disabling the whole layer:

```yaml
lsp:
  servers:
    rust-analyzer:
      disabled: true
```

## Troubleshooting

**`hermes lsp status` shows a server as "missing"**

The binary isn't on PATH and isn't in `<HERMES_HOME>/lsp/bin/`. Run
`hermes lsp install <server_id>` to attempt an auto-install, or
install the binary manually through the language's normal toolchain.

**`Backend warnings` section in `hermes lsp status`**

Some servers ship as thin wrappers around an external CLI for actual
diagnostics — they spawn cleanly and accept requests but never emit
errors when the sidecar binary is missing. The most common case is
`bash-language-server`, which delegates diagnostics to `shellcheck`.
When `hermes lsp status` shows a `Backend warnings` section, install
the named tool through your OS package manager:

```
apt install shellcheck      # Debian / Ubuntu
brew install shellcheck     # macOS
scoop install shellcheck    # Windows
```

The same warning is logged once at server spawn time in
`~/.hermes/logs/agent.log`.

**Server starts but never returns diagnostics**

Check `~/.hermes/logs/agent.log` for `[agent.lsp.client]` entries —
both stderr from the language server and protocol errors land
there. Some servers (rust-analyzer especially) need to finish a
project-wide index before they emit per-file diagnostics; the first
edit after server start may complete with no diagnostics, with
subsequent edits picking them up.

**Server crashed**

A crashed server is added to the broken-set and won't be retried for
the rest of the session. Run `hermes lsp restart` to clear the set;
the next edit re-spawns.

**Editing a file outside any git repo**

By design, LSP only runs inside a git repository. If the project isn't
yet initialized, run `git init` to enable LSP diagnostics. Otherwise the
in-process syntax-only fallback applies.
