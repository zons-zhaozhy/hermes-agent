# Running Many Gateways at Once

Operate multiple [profiles](./profiles.md) — each with its own bot tokens,
sessions, and memory — as managed services on a single machine. This page
covers the operational concerns: starting them all together, viewing logs
across profiles, preventing the host from sleeping, and recovering from common
launchd/systemd quirks.

If you only run one Hermes agent, you don't need this page — see
[Profiles](./profiles.md) for the basics. And if your instances live on
*different* machines that one desktop app should reach simultaneously, see
[Connecting Desktop to Many Hermes Instances](./multi-connection-desktop.md).

## When to use this

You want this setup when you have two or more Hermes agents that should all
be online at the same time. Common reasons:

- A personal assistant on one Telegram bot and a coding agent on another
- One agent per family member or one per Slack workspace
- Sandbox + production instances of the same configuration
- A research agent + a writing agent + a cron-driven bot — each with isolated
  memory and skills

Every profile already gets its own per-platform LaunchAgent
(`ai.hermes.gateway-<name>.plist`) or systemd user service
(`hermes-gateway-<name>.service`). This guide adds the patterns for managing
them collectively.

## Quick start

```bash
# Create profiles (once)
hermes profile create coder
hermes profile create personal-bot
hermes profile create research

# Configure each
coder setup
personal-bot setup
research setup

# Install each gateway as a managed service
coder gateway install
personal-bot gateway install
research gateway install

# Start them all
coder gateway start
personal-bot gateway start
research gateway start
```

That's it — three independent agents, each on its own process, restarting
automatically on crash and on user login.

## Alternative: one gateway for all profiles (multiplexing)

The model above runs **one process per profile**. That is the default and is
the right choice for most setups. But on a host with many profiles — or a
container deployment where one process per profile is operationally heavy — you
can instead run a **single multiplexing gateway**: the default profile's gateway
becomes the sole inbound process and serves messages for *every* profile on the
box.

This is **opt-in** and **off by default**. When it's off, nothing on this page
changes — every behavior below is inert.

### When to prefer multiplexing

- A container/VPS deployment where N supervisor units, N ports, and N PID files
  are a burden.
- Many low-traffic profiles that don't each justify a full process.
- You want a single thing to start, monitor, and restart.

Stick with one-process-per-profile when you want hard process-level isolation
between profiles (separate memory footprints, independent crash domains, the
ability to restart one profile without touching the others).

### How to opt in

Set the flag on the **default profile** (it owns the multiplexer) and restart
its gateway:

```bash
hermes config set gateway.multiplex_profiles true
hermes gateway restart
```

Equivalently, in the default profile's `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
gateway:
  multiplex_profiles: true
```

(The flag is also accepted as a top-level `multiplex_profiles: true` for
convenience.) On the next start the default gateway enumerates every profile,
brings up each profile's enabled platforms under that profile's own
credentials, and routes each inbound message to the profile it belongs to. Each
turn resolves the routed profile's config, skills, memory, SOUL, **and provider
keys** — credentials are never shared across profiles.

You do **not** run `hermes gateway start` for the secondary profiles — the
default gateway serves them. See the contract changes below.

### What changes when multiplexing is on

Enabling the flag changes how a few things behave. All of these revert the
moment the flag is off.

#### 1. Secondary profiles must not start their own gateway

With a multiplexer running, a named-profile `hermes gateway run`, `start`,
`install` or `restart` is a **hard error** (exit code 78), pointing you back at
the multiplexer:

```
The default gateway is running as a profile multiplexer and already serves
profile 'coder'. ...
```

The refusal happens in the CLI before any service manager is touched, so a served
profile never ends up with a permanently failed systemd unit or a launchd respawn
loop. `hermes -p coder gateway stop` refuses the same way (exit 78) when coder has no
gateway of its own — there is nothing to stop but the multiplexer, which
`hermes gateway stop` on the default profile takes down for every served profile.
The dashboard and Desktop app follow the CLI: for a served profile the "Start" and
"Stop" gateway actions answer `409` with the same explanation, and "Restart"
restarts the multiplexer (the process that actually serves the profile) instead of
spawning a `-p coder gateway restart` that could only fail.
"Served" is read from the running gateway's own record (`served_profiles` in the
default home's `gateway_state.json`), so it stays correct when the multiplexer was
enabled only through `GATEWAY_MULTIPLEX_PROFILES` in the default profile's
environment, or when profiles were added after the gateway started.

The multiplexer is the single inbound process; a second profile gateway would
double-bind that profile's platforms. Pass `--force` (accepted by `run`, `start`,
`install` and `restart`) only if you deliberately want a separate process for that
profile (not recommended while the multiplexer is running). The cross-profile
lifecycle wrapper script earlier on this page is therefore **not** used in
multiplex mode — you only manage the default gateway.

#### 2. HTTP-inbound platforms are reached via a `/p/<profile>/` URL prefix

HTTP-inbound traffic for a secondary profile arrives on the default profile's
**one** listener under a profile prefix, **not** a second port:

```
# default profile
POST http://host:8644/webhooks/<route>
# the "coder" profile, same listener
POST http://host:8644/p/coder/webhooks/<route>
```

An unknown or unconfigured profile in the prefix returns `404`. The shared
listener is the default profile's `api_server` port (or its `webhook` port when
no API server is enabled); it serves three kinds of profile-prefixed paths:

- **`api_server` and `webhook` are mirrored**, never duplicated. `/p/coder/v1/...`
  and `/p/coder/webhooks/<route>` are answered by the default profile's own
  adapter under coder's scope. A secondary must therefore **not** enable
  `api_server` or `webhook` itself (the dashboard refuses with `409`; an
  `API_SERVER_KEY` or `WEBHOOK_ENABLED` in the secondary's `.env` wires the
  credential without starting a listener).
- **Every other inbound-port platform runs in shared-listener mode.** A
  secondary that configures Twilio SMS, LINE, Teams, BlueBubbles, Microsoft
  Graph, WhatsApp Cloud, WeCom callback or Feishu webhook mode gets its **own**
  adapter instance built without a port; the default listener forwards
  `/p/<profile>/<the adapter's usual path>` to it. See
  [Inbound-port platforms under the multiplexer](#inbound-port-platforms-under-the-multiplexer).

Authentication follows the profile named in the URL. Unprefixed endpoints keep
using the default listener's existing credentials.

- `/p/coder/...` API-server requests must use `API_SERVER_KEY` from
  `~/.hermes/profiles/coder/.env`; the default listener key is rejected. Under
  the multiplexer that key only authenticates the prefix — it does not turn on a
  second `api_server` listener in the secondary profile, so you do not need to
  pin `platforms.api_server.enabled: false` in the secondary's `config.yaml`.
- A webhook route that targets `coder` must declare `profile: coder` beside
  its existing route-specific `secret` in the default profile's
  `config.yaml`. That secret is then accepted only at
  `/p/coder/webhooks/<route>` and is rejected on every other profile prefix.
- Webhook routes without `profile` remain default-profile routes and are not
  reachable through a named profile prefix.
- Delivery follows the same binding. A `profile: coder` route's reply (or
  `deliver_only` message) goes out through **coder's** adapter for the
  `deliver` platform, falls back to **coder's** home channel when
  `deliver_extra.chat_id` is unset, and a `github_comment` delivery runs `gh`
  with `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` from `profiles/coder/.env`. If coder has no
  adapter for that platform the delivery fails (502) rather than posting as
  another profile's bot; a default route likewise never borrows a platform that
  is enabled only on a secondary profile.
- `/p/coder/api/platforms/<platform>/events` callbacks are verified and
  dispatched by coder's adapter; when coder has none the callback is a 503.

Named API requests fail closed when the target profile has no
`API_SERVER_KEY`. Security configuration errors remain fatal: for example, an
`open` own-policy platform without `GATEWAY_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` or its
platform-specific allow-all opt-in still aborts gateway startup rather than
silently dropping the unsafe profile.

#### Inbound-port platforms under the multiplexer

A standalone `hermes -p coder gateway run` binds coder's Twilio, LINE, Teams,
… webhook servers on their own ports. Under the multiplexer those adapters are
still coder's — same credentials from `profiles/coder/.env`, same
`config.yaml`, replies sent through coder's channel — but they bind **no port**.
The default profile's shared listener forwards `/p/coder/<path>` to them, where
`<path>` is exactly the path the adapter would serve standalone. The request is
verified by **coder's** adapter with **coder's** secret (Twilio auth token, LINE
channel secret, Teams app credentials, BlueBubbles password, …) and runs under
coder's runtime scope; the default profile's own `/path` is untouched, and a
profile that has no adapter for a path gets `404`, never another profile's bot.

| Platform | Secondary profile's callback URL on the shared listener | Verified with the named profile's |
|---|---|---|
| Twilio SMS (`sms`) | `https://<host>/p/<profile>/webhooks/twilio` | `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` signature (`SMS_WEBHOOK_URL` must be this URL) |
| LINE (`line`) | `https://<host>/p/<profile>/line/webhook` (media: `/p/<profile>/line/media/...`) | `LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET` |
| Microsoft Teams (`teams`) | `https://<host>/p/<profile>/api/messages` | Bot Framework token for `TEAMS_CLIENT_ID` |
| BlueBubbles (`bluebubbles`) | `http://<host>/p/<profile>/bluebubbles-webhook` (registered with the server automatically) | `BLUEBUBBLES_PASSWORD` |
| Microsoft Graph (`msgraph_webhook`) | `https://<host>/p/<profile>/msgraph/webhook` | `extra.client_state` |
| WhatsApp Cloud (`whatsapp_cloud`) | `https://<host>/p/<profile>/whatsapp/webhook` | `WHATSAPP_CLOUD_APP_SECRET` / verify token |
| WeCom callback (`wecom_callback`) | `https://<host>/p/<profile>/wecom/callback` | the app's callback token / AES key |
| Feishu webhook mode (`feishu`) | `https://<host>/p/<profile>/feishu/webhook` | `FEISHU_VERIFICATION_TOKEN` / `FEISHU_ENCRYPT_KEY` |

`<host>` is the public hostname (tunnel, reverse proxy) in front of the default
profile's listener; a custom `webhook_path` in the profile's config moves the
path after `/p/<profile>` accordingly. The gateway logs the exact URL at
startup:

```
[sms] profile 'coder' is served on the default profile's shared listener:
http://127.0.0.1:8642/p/coder/webhooks/twilio (point the vendor's callback URL at this path ...)
```

and every status surface repeats it, so you know what to paste into the vendor
console:

```
$ hermes -p coder gateway status
✓ Gateway is running via the default-profile multiplexer
  Manage it from the default profile: hermes gateway status

Inbound callback URLs on the shared listener:
  line: http://127.0.0.1:8642/p/coder/line/webhook
  sms: http://127.0.0.1:8642/p/coder/webhooks/twilio
```

`hermes gateway status` and `hermes status` on the default profile list the same
URLs per served profile, and the dashboard's Channels page shows them as each
platform's `ingress_url` when viewing that profile. A per-profile
`SMS_WEBHOOK_PORT`, `LINE_PORT`, `TEAMS_PORT`, … in a secondary's `.env` is
ignored under the multiplexer (nothing binds); it applies again the moment that
profile runs its own standalone gateway.

#### 3. Per-credential platforms still need their own token per profile

Polling/connection platforms (Telegram, Discord, Slack, Matrix, Signal, …) work
fine multiplexed, but each profile that enables one must supply its **own** bot
token — the same token cannot be polled by two profiles at once. If two profiles
configure the same `(platform, token)`, the gateway logs an error naming both
profiles and parks the **duplicate** adapter (it shows as `fatal /
duplicate_credential` in runtime status) while the first claimant and every
other profile keep running — the gateway itself does not exit. The default
profile's adapters connect first and claim their credentials, so the parked
adapter is always the secondary's (see
[Token-conflict safety](#token-conflict-safety) — the rule is unchanged, it's
just enforced inside the one process now).

#### 4. Session keys are namespaced by profile

Each profile's sessions live under an `agent:<profile>:…` namespace so two
profiles on the same platform/chat never collide in the shared session store.
The **default** profile keeps the historical `agent:main:…` namespace
byte-for-byte, so existing default-profile sessions are unaffected — no
migration, no orphaned history. Every gateway path that reads a key back —
delegation completions after a restart, shutdown notices, a per-user-thread
`/stop` of a sibling's run, `/undo`, QQ approval buttons — accepts the
`agent:<profile>:…` shape too, so secondary profiles get the same behaviour
as the default one.

Each profile's rows land in **its own** `state.db`: a named profile's under
`profiles/<name>/state.db`, the default profile's under the launch home — even
when the write happens inside another profile's routed turn or background tick.
The Desktop/TUI backend's own store is likewise pinned to the home it launched
under, and a Bot Chat's side agents (`prompt.background`) persist next to their
parent conversation.

#### 5. One PID/lock and one status surface

There is a single process-level PID and lock (the multiplexer, under the default
home). `hermes status` on the default profile reports the multiplexer and lists
the profiles it serves (`Serves: coder, research`); `hermes -p coder status`,
`hermes -p coder gateway status` and `hermes -p coder cron status` all report
"running via the default-profile multiplexer" instead of "stopped", and the
dashboard's `/api/status?profile=coder` / Channels page report the multiplexer as
coder's running gateway (with coder's own adapters as its platforms). The single
`gateway_state.json` lives under the default home: secondary adapters appear
there as `<profile>:<platform>` entries beside `served_profiles`; nothing is
written under a secondary profile's home.

#### What does **not** change

Per-profile `.env` credential isolation is preserved and, if anything,
stricter: a profile's keys are resolved from its own scope and are never unioned
into a shared environment. Subprocesses like MCP servers and Kanban workers only
ever see their own profile's secrets — including credentials injected by an
external secret source (1Password, Bitwarden, …): a stdio MCP server started for
profile B receives B's value for such a name, or nothing if B has none, never the
default profile's. MCP servers are connected **per profile**: two profiles that
both name a server `github` with their own token get two connections and each
sees only its own tools; profiles whose `mcp_servers` entry is identical (same
route *and* credentials) share one connection, and an owner's `/reload-mcp`
re-registers the sharing profiles' tools without them reloading. Terminal settings
(`terminal.backend`, `terminal.cwd`, `terminal.docker_volumes`,
`terminal.docker_shared_container_key`, SSH targets, …) are likewise resolved
per profile on every routed turn: a profile that omits a terminal key gets the
documented default, never the launch profile's value, and a profile whose
`config.yaml`/`.env` cannot be parsed has terminal execution refused rather than
run under another profile's sandbox policy. The media-delivery credential
guard (the denylist behind `MEDIA:` attachments — `.env`, `auth.json`,
`config.yaml`, `state.db`, session transcripts, OAuth token stores) covers every
profile under `profiles/`, so no profile's turn can attach another profile's
secrets or chat history to a reply. Authorization is per profile too:
`GATEWAY_ALLOW_ALL_USERS`, `GATEWAY_ALLOWED_USERS` and every platform allowlist
or allow-all opt-in are read from the owning profile's `.env` — the default
profile opting into open access never opens a secondary profile's bot, and a
secondary that opts in only in its own `.env` is honored. The same holds for
per-bot behaviour written in a profile's `config.yaml` (`require_mention`,
`mention_patterns`, `allow_bots`, `reactions`, `auto_thread`, `dm_policy`,
`ignored_channels`, Matrix `session_scope`, …): a secondary profile's YAML never
lands in the shared process environment, so it cannot become the default
profile's policy, and the default profile's YAML never governs a secondary
bot. The `terminal.env_passthrough` allowlist, the Yuanbao auto-designated
home channel, and the write guards protecting each profile's own `config.yaml`
are resolved per profile as well. Kanban, profile-scoped skills/memory/SOUL, and
model routing all behave per-profile exactly as they do with separate gateways.

Outbound identity is per profile too. A turn running for profile `P` that calls
the `send_message` tool (send, react, media) posts through `P`'s own bot;
so do the "Gateway shutting down/restarted" and `/update` notices for `P`'s
sessions, `/loop` wakeups set from `P`'s chats, and the Discord
unauthorized-slash operator alert of `P`'s Discord bot (to `P`'s home
channel). If `P` has no connected bot for that platform the send fails with a
clear error — it never falls back to the default profile's bot.

Tool and memory-provider credentials follow the same rule. Hosted OCR
(`FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`), Modal / Browser Use cloud gates, the mem0 OSS OpenAI
key, xAI video, and every memory-provider identity (`MEM0_USER_ID`,
`SUPERMEMORY_CONTAINER_TAG`, `RETAINDB_PROJECT`, `OPENVIKING_ACCOUNT/USER`,
`HINDSIGHT_BANK_ID`, `HERMES_HONCHO_HOST`) are read from the routed profile's
`.env`, so a secondary profile's memories land in **its** account/bank/project
(or the provider's per-profile default), never the default profile's. Custom
endpoints travel with their keys — `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `XAI_BASE_URL`,
`NOUS_INFERENCE_BASE_URL`, `GATEWAY_PROXY_URL`, Firecrawl / Browserbase /
RetainDB / Supermemory / Honcho / Hindsight URLs — so a profile's key is never
sent to another profile's proxy or self-hosted server. `WEIXIN_HOME_CHANNEL`,
`HERMES_LANGUAGE` and `display.language`, and `hooks.outbound[].secret_env` are
likewise per profile, and end-of-session memory extraction for an evicted
secondary session runs under that profile's scope.

Per-turn runtime settings follow the routed profile as well: `agent.max_turns`,
`fallback_providers`, `file_read_max_chars`, `tool_output.*`, `browser.*`
timeouts, `timezone` (including the `TZ` handed to `execute_code` sandboxes),
the media-delivery policy (`gateway.strict`, `media_delivery_allow_dirs`,
`trust_recent_files*`) and the Nous `auth.json` used for auxiliary calls are all
read from the profile serving the turn, never from the profile the gateway was
launched under. The same holds for per-profile state files (`processes.json`,
`checkpoints/`, sandbox snapshot stores, Feishu comment rules/pairing) and for
gateway hooks: each profile's `hooks/` directory is loaded on its own and fires
only for that profile's events. Shell hooks run with the routed profile's
`HERMES_HOME`, without the default profile's secrets in their environment, and
their stdin payload carries a `profile` field naming the profile that fired them.

#### What is isolated per profile

A quick reference for what a multiplexed turn resolves from **its own**
profile and never shares with the default or any sibling:

| Concern | Resolved from | Behaviour when the profile lacks it |
|---|---|---|
| Provider keys, bot tokens, `${VAR}` refs in `config.yaml` | The profile's own `.env` (its secret scope) | Unresolved / no adapter — never the default profile's value |
| Authorization (`GATEWAY_ALLOW_ALL_USERS`, `GATEWAY_ALLOWED_USERS`, per-platform allowlists and allow-all opt-ins) | The owning profile's `.env` and `config.yaml` | Closed — a default-profile opt-in never opens a secondary's bot |
| HTTP endpoints (`/p/<profile>/api/...`, `/p/<profile>/webhooks/...`, platform event callbacks) | The named profile's `API_SERVER_KEY`, `profile:`-bound webhook routes, and its own adapter | `401`/`404`; delivery without an adapter is `502`/`503`, never another profile's bot |
| Inbound-port platforms (`/p/<profile>/webhooks/twilio`, `/p/<profile>/line/webhook`, `/p/<profile>/api/messages`, …) | The named profile's own adapter and its secret (Twilio auth token, LINE channel secret, Teams app, BlueBubbles password, …); replies leave through that adapter | `401`/`403` on a wrong secret, `404` when the profile has no such adapter — never the default profile's adapter |
| Adapter settings (`*_REQUIRE_MENTION`, `*_REACTIONS`, `*_PROXY`, webhook host/port/URL, Matrix thread/session/E2EE policy, Discord backfill/attachment caps, Buzz reply mode, A2A agent card) | The owning profile's `.env` and `config.yaml` | The adapter's documented default — never the default profile's setting |
| `MEDIA:` attachment denylist | Every home under `profiles/` plus the default home, enumerated at check time | A turn can never attach another profile's `.env`, `auth.json`, `state.db`, sessions or token stores |
| stdio MCP child environment | Safe baseline + the profile's scoped values for secret-source names + the server's own `env:` | A name the profile lacks is absent from the child — no default-profile fallthrough |
| Outbound egress (`send_message`, shutdown/restart/`/update` notices, `/loop` wakeups, `profile:`-bound webhook delivery, `github_comment` tokens) | The profile's own connected adapter and `.env` | Clear failure; never posts through the default profile's bot |
| Session namespace | `agent:<profile>:…` (default keeps `agent:main:…`) | Two profiles on the same chat never share history |
| Logs | `agent.log` / `errors.log` / `gateway.log` under the profile's own home | — |
| Terminal sandbox settings (`terminal.*`, SSH targets) | The profile's `config.yaml` | Documented default; unparsable config → execution refused |
| Working directory of a turn (unset `terminal.cwd`) | Same rule as a standalone gateway: `$HOME` for the local backend, sandbox default otherwise | Never the directory the multiplexer process was launched from |
| Command approvals (`command_allowlist`, "always" choices) | The profile's own `config.yaml` | A default-profile "always" never pre-approves a secondary's command; a secondary's choice is saved to its own config |
| Sandbox credential-file mounts (`terminal.credential_files`), `security.redact_secrets`, `browser.*` engine/headed flags, `lsp.*`, auxiliary-provider health marks, `logs/mcp-stderr.log` | The profile's own `config.yaml` / `.env` | Documented default — never the launch profile's cached value |
| Cloud-SDK credential clients (Bedrock boto3 clients + model discovery, Azure Entra credential), credential-fetched catalogs (DeepInfra, Copilot context limits, Nous reasoning caps, Ramp Router efforts, xAI / OpenRouter image models, custom-endpoint `/models`), Camofox VNC address, computer-use aux-vision routing, skill-sync push, remote-backend probe text, learned image token costs, `display.skin`, guest-mint back-off, banner skills, Yuanbao "active" adapter, Langfuse client | The profile's own `.env` / `config.yaml` / `<home>/cache` | Documented default — never the launch profile's cached value or its credentials |
| Session-search knobs (`sessions.cjk_fts`, `sessions.search_slow_ms`) | The profile's `config.yaml` | Documented default — never the default profile's bridged value |
| Platform proxies (`TELEGRAM_PROXY`, `DISCORD_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, …) | The profile's own `.env` | Direct connection — never the default profile's proxy |
| MCP discovery in the Desktop/dashboard backend | Once per served profile home | A profile selected after another has already built an agent still discovers its own `mcp_servers` |
| Dashboard actions (`hermes -p <name> …` spawned by the Desktop/dashboard) | A scrubbed child env pinned to that profile's `HERMES_HOME` | The child loads its own `.env`; the dashboard profile's tokens and ports are not inherited |
| Cron `.env` tuning (`HERMES_CRON_TIMEOUT`, `HERMES_MODEL` fallback, `HERMES_CRON_MAX_PARALLEL`, prefill file), worker / Bot Chat child env | The profile's own `.env`; children never inherit the default profile's `.env` settings or bridged `TERMINAL_*` policy | Cron defaults / model refusal, exactly as a standalone `hermes -p <name> gateway run` |
| Kanban workers and notifications for a profile's tasks | The assignee's `.env` + `config.yaml` (toolset pin, terminal backend, media policy, display language) | — |
| `/loop` ticks, `background_process_notifications` gate, `notice_delivery`, background-process checkpoint recovery | The owning profile's `state.db` / `config.yaml` / `processes.json` | — |

What is **shared** by design: the process, its PID/lock and `gateway_state.json`
(default home), the one HTTP listener, and the `profile_routes` table (declared
on the default profile).

### Which profiles are served

`gateway.multiplex_profiles: true` serves the default profile plus **every**
live named profile under `profiles/` — there is no per-profile opt-out list.
(The former `gateway.multiplex_profile_allowlist` key is retired; a config
migration removes it from `config.yaml`, and a profile you do not want served is
archived or deleted instead — `hermes profile delete <name>`, or move the
directory out of `profiles/`.) Deleted profiles leave a tombstone and are never
enumerated; a profile whose directory is gone is never recreated by a served
turn, the cron ticker or log routing.

The served set controls `/p/<profile>/` API and webhook prefixes, runtime
status, profile-route eligibility, and which profiles the in-process cron
scheduler ticks (the Desktop backend's ticker enumerates the same set and stands
down for any profile a running multiplexer or its own gateway already serves). A
multiplexer started as `hermes -p <name> gateway run` always ticks its own
profile's cron store as well.

One caveat: the served set is a **start-time snapshot**. A profile created while
the multiplexer is running is not picked up until `hermes gateway restart`
(profiles deleted at runtime are dropped from cron ticking automatically).

### Routing shared-bot chats to profiles (`profile_routes`)

Multiplexing selects a profile per **credential** (each profile's own bot
token) or per **URL prefix** (`/p/<profile>/` for HTTP platforms). When several
communities share **one** bot token — for example one Discord bot serving many
guilds — you can additionally route specific guilds/channels/threads to
different profiles with `gateway.profile_routes`:

```yaml
gateway:
  multiplex_profiles: true
  profile_routes:
    # An entire Discord server → one profile
    - name: acme-server
      platform: discord
      guild_id: "1234567890"
      profile: acme

    # One channel in that server → a different profile
    - name: acme-support
      platform: discord
      guild_id: "1234567890"
      chat_id: "9876543210"
      profile: acme-support

    # A Telegram group (no guild concept — chat_id only)
    - name: tg-group
      platform: telegram
      chat_id: "-1001234567890"
      profile: tg-profile

    # A WhatsApp DM — write the phone number; JID and LID forms also match
    - name: owner-whatsapp
      platform: whatsapp
      chat_id: "15551234567"
      profile: owner
```

Routes are matched most-specific-first (`thread_id` > `chat_id` > `guild_id`),
all declared fields must hold (AND), and a route keyed on a channel also
matches threads/forum posts whose parent is that channel. Messages that match
no route stay on the default/active profile. The routed profile gets the full
per-profile isolation described above (config, skills, memory, credentials,
session namespace). Routing works on every platform adapter, not just Discord.

A route applies only to messages received by the **default profile's bot**
unless it names another bot with `bot_profile: <profile>`. Telegram DMs use the
same `chat_id` for every bot (the user's id), so without this a
`chat_id` route meant for the shared bot would also capture that user's DMs
with a secondary profile's dedicated bot. Messages arriving at a secondary
profile's own bot stay in that profile:

```yaml
    # Pin one user's DM with team_b's OWN bot to a third profile
    - name: teamb-owner-dm
      platform: telegram
      bot_profile: team_b
      chat_id: "72719239"
      profile: ops-for-team-b
```

Authorization for a routed message is always decided by the **receiving bot's
profile** (its token and allowlist), including follow-ups sent while the agent
is busy and mid-turn checks such as `/topic` or `/stop`; the routed profile
itself needs no copy of the allowlist. A routed profile without a bot of its
own also receives background notifications (process completions, heartbeats,
async delegation results) through the shared bot after a gateway restart.

On WhatsApp and WhatsApp Cloud, a `chat_id` route matches across user-identity
forms: a bare phone number (`15551234567`), a JID
(`15551234567@s.whatsapp.net`), and a LID (`…@lid`) all refer to the same
person once the bridge has paired them (the same canonicalization session keys
and adapter allowlists already use). You can put the phone number in
`profile_routes` and inbound DMs still match whether WhatsApp delivers a JID or
a LID. Without a LID mapping yet, the number form still matches a JID (the
suffix is stripped) but cannot resolve an unknown LID — that inbound falls
through to the default profile until the mapping appears. Group chats
(`…@g.us`) are not sender identities and still match exactly. Telegram numeric
ids are unchanged.

`profile_routes` requires `gateway.multiplex_profiles: true`; with
multiplexing off the routes are ignored. If an explicit route matches but its
target profile is not installed (or was deleted), the gateway rejects that ingress and logs the route and target. It does not run
the default profile. Traffic that matches no route keeps the historical
default-profile behavior.

Cron jobs owned by a routed profile deliver through the shared bot too, but
only to targets an enabled route with a `chat_id`/`thread_id` maps to that
profile (a `guild_id + chat_id` route qualifies its channel) — a routed
profile's job targeting an unrouted chat (or a chat routed to another profile)
is never sent through the shared bot. Guild-only routes do not qualify a cron
target; add a `chat_id` route for the delivery channel. The routed profile does
not need its own `platforms.<platform>` block for this: the shared bot's
authorization comes from the route, not from the satellite's config.

## Start, stop, or restart all gateways at once

The CLI ships with single-profile lifecycle commands. To act across every
profile, wrap them in a shell loop. Put the snippet below in
`~/.local/bin/hermes-gateways` and `chmod +x` it:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -eu

# Add or remove profile names here as you create / delete profiles.
profiles="default coder personal-bot research"

usage() {
  echo "Usage: hermes-gateways {start|stop|restart|status|list}"
}

run_for_profile() {
  profile="$1"
  action="$2"
  if [ "$profile" = "default" ]; then
    hermes gateway "$action"
  else
    hermes -p "$profile" gateway "$action"
  fi
}

action="${1:-}"
case "$action" in
  start|stop|restart|status)
    for profile in $profiles; do
      echo "==> $action $profile"
      run_for_profile "$profile" "$action"
    done
    ;;
  list)
    hermes gateway list
    ;;
  *)
    usage
    exit 2
    ;;
esac
```

Then:

```bash
hermes-gateways start      # start every configured profile
hermes-gateways stop       # stop every configured profile
hermes-gateways restart    # restart all
hermes-gateways status     # status across all
hermes-gateways list       # delegates to `hermes gateway list`
```

:::tip
The `default` profile is targeted with `hermes gateway <action>` (no `-p`),
not `hermes -p default gateway <action>`. The wrapper above handles both forms.
:::

## Manage one profile

The shortcut commands every profile installs:

```bash
coder gateway run        # foreground (Ctrl-C to stop)
coder gateway start      # start the managed service
coder gateway stop       # stop the managed service
coder gateway restart    # restart
coder gateway status     # status
coder gateway install    # create the LaunchAgent / systemd unit
coder gateway uninstall  # remove the service file
```

These are equivalent to `hermes -p coder gateway <action>` — useful if a
profile alias is not on `PATH` or if you target profiles dynamically from a
script.

## Service files

Each profile installs its own service with a unique name, so installations
never clash:

| Platform | Path                                                              |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS    | `~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.hermes.gateway-<profile>.plist`        |
| Linux    | `~/.config/systemd/user/hermes-gateway-<profile>.service`         |

The default profile keeps the historical names: `ai.hermes.gateway.plist` /
`hermes-gateway.service`.

## Viewing logs

Each profile writes to its own log files:

```bash
# Default profile
tail -f ~/.hermes/logs/gateway.log
tail -f ~/.hermes/logs/gateway.error.log

# Named profile
tail -f ~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/logs/gateway.log
tail -f ~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/logs/gateway.error.log
```

Stream every profile's log simultaneously:

```bash
tail -f ~/.hermes/logs/gateway.log ~/.hermes/profiles/*/logs/gateway.log
```

The CLI also has a structured log viewer:

```bash
hermes logs -f                  # follow default profile
hermes -p coder logs -f         # follow one profile
hermes logs --help              # filters, levels, JSON output
```

## Identify what's actually running

```bash
hermes profile list             # profiles + model + gateway state
hermes-gateways status          # full status across every profile
launchctl list | grep hermes    # macOS — PIDs and labels
systemctl --user list-units 'hermes-gateway-*'   # Linux — units
```

## Editing configuration

Every profile keeps its config inside its own directory:

```
~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/
├── .env              # API keys, bot tokens (chmod 600)
├── config.yaml       # model, provider, toolsets, gateway settings
└── SOUL.md           # personality / system prompt
```

The default profile uses `~/.hermes/` directly with the same three files.

Edit them with any editor or via the CLI:

```bash
hermes config set model.model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4    # default profile
coder config set model.model openai/gpt-5                  # named profile
```

After editing `.env` or `config.yaml`, restart the affected gateway:

```bash
coder gateway restart
# or, for everything:
hermes-gateways restart
```

## Keeping the host awake

The gateway process can run all day, but the operating system will still try
to sleep when idle. Two patterns:

### macOS — `caffeinate`

`caffeinate` is built into macOS and prevents sleep while it runs. No install.

```bash
caffeinate -dis                    # block display, idle, and system sleep
caffeinate -dis -t 28800           # same, auto-exit after 8 hours
caffeinate -i -w $(cat ~/.hermes/gateway.pid) &   # awake while default gateway runs

# Persistent: run in background and forget
nohup caffeinate -dis >/dev/null 2>&1 &
disown

# Inspect / stop
pmset -g assertions | grep -iE 'caffeinate|prevent|user is active'
pkill caffeinate
```

| Flag   | Effect                                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `-d`   | block display sleep                               |
| `-i`   | block idle system sleep (default)                 |
| `-m`   | block disk sleep                                  |
| `-s`   | block system sleep (AC-powered Macs only)         |
| `-u`   | simulate user activity (prevents screen lock)     |
| `-t N` | auto-exit after `N` seconds                       |
| `-w P` | exit when PID `P` exits                           |

:::warning Lid-close still sleeps the Mac
`caffeinate` cannot override the hardware-driven lid-close sleep on MacBooks.
For lid-closed operation, change your Energy Saver / Battery preferences or
use a third-party tool.
:::

### Linux — `systemd-inhibit` or `loginctl`

```bash
# Inhibit suspend while a command runs
systemd-inhibit --what=idle:sleep --who=hermes --why="gateways running" \
  sleep infinity &

# Allow user services to keep running after logout (recommended)
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
```

After enabling lingering, your systemd user units (including
`hermes-gateway-<profile>.service`) continue running across SSH disconnects
and reboots.

## Token-conflict safety

Each profile must use unique bot tokens for each platform. If two profiles
share a Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, or Signal token, the second
gateway refuses to start with an error naming the conflicting profile. Under
[multiplexing](#alternative-one-gateway-for-all-profiles-multiplexing) the same
rule parks only the duplicate profile's adapter and the shared gateway keeps
running.

To audit:

```bash
grep -H 'TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN\|DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN' \
     ~/.hermes/.env ~/.hermes/profiles/*/.env
```

## Migrating from per-profile gateways

If your profiles each run their own gateway today (one systemd unit or launchd
agent per profile), you can fold them into a single multiplexed default gateway
with one command — and roll back with another. Standalone per-profile gateways
remain fully supported; this is an optional migration, not a removal.

```bash
hermes gateway migrate --multiplex --dry-run   # print the plan and any blockers; changes nothing
hermes gateway migrate --multiplex             # apply (asks for confirmation on a TTY; -y skips)
hermes gateway migrate --standalone            # roll back to per-profile gateways
```

### What `hermes update` does

After a successful update, when the install has two or more profiles, at least
one secondary profile runs its own gateway (a live process or an installed
service) and `gateway.multiplex_profiles` is off, `hermes update` runs the same
preflight:

- **Nothing blocks it** → the migration runs automatically (the same code path
  as `hermes gateway migrate --multiplex --yes`) and prints what it did. This
  is deterministic and never prompts, so it also runs on headless/cron updates.
- **Something blocks it** → a warning block lists each blocker with its exact
  fix and the one-liner to run later. Nothing is changed.

Single-profile installs are never migrated (there is nothing to gain), and an
install that is already multiplexing is left alone.

### What the migration does

1. Stops each secondary profile's standalone gateway and uninstalls its
   service (systemd user/system unit or launchd agent). What was removed is
   recorded in `~/.hermes/gateway_migration.json` for rollback.
2. Sets `gateway.multiplex_profiles: true` in the **default** profile's
   `config.yaml`.
3. Restarts the default gateway — or installs and starts it on the same service
   manager the secondaries were using, so a systemd-managed fleet stays
   systemd-managed.
4. Waits for the default gateway to record `served_profiles` covering every
   profile, then prints a summary.

### Blockers and fixes

| Blocker | Why | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Two profiles configure the same platform credential (e.g. the same `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`) | Under one process a bot token can only be polled once; the multiplexer would park the duplicate and that profile's bot would go silent | Remove the token from the second profile, or keep it in `default` and route that profile's chats with [`profile_routes`](#routing-shared-bot-chats-to-profiles-profile_routes) |
| A secondary profile enables a port-binding platform that has **no** `/p/<profile>/` ingress on the default listener | The multiplexer skips that whole profile (see [rule 2](#2-http-inbound-platforms-are-reached-via-a-pprofile-url-prefix)) | Disable the platform in that profile (`platforms.<name>.enabled: false`), or keep the profile on a standalone gateway with `hermes -p <name> gateway start --force` |

The credential check reuses the gateway's own conflict detection, so its verdict
matches what the multiplexer does at startup. Which port-binding platforms have
a `/p/<profile>/` ingress is read from the adapters themselves (each declares
`serves_profile_prefix`), so the preflight stays correct as new HTTP-inbound
adapters gain the prefix.

### What changes for inbound-port profiles

A secondary profile that used `api_server` or `webhook` on its own port is
**not** blocked — but its URL changes. The preflight prints the exact new URL,
for example:

```
Profile 'coder': api_server moves onto the default listener at
http://127.0.0.1:8642/p/coder/v1/... (its key/secret is unchanged; update
clients that call the old per-profile port).
```

The profile's own `API_SERVER_KEY` / webhook secret keeps authenticating the
prefixed URL; nothing else about the key changes.

### Profiles created after the migration

The multiplexer snapshots the profile set at startup. `hermes profile create`
prints the reminder when a live multiplexer is detected: run
`hermes gateway restart` (from the default profile) and the new profile is
served.

### Rollback

```bash
hermes gateway migrate --standalone
```

reads `gateway_migration.json`, sets `gateway.multiplex_profiles` back to its
previous value, restarts the default gateway, and reinstalls/starts every
recorded per-profile service. The manifest is removed once everything is back.
If no manifest exists (you enabled multiplexing by hand), leave multiplex mode
with `hermes config set gateway.multiplex_profiles false && hermes gateway restart`
and reinstall the per-profile services you want.

Not covered automatically: s6-supervised containers (set the flag on the
default profile and restart the container) and Windows Scheduled Tasks (set the
flag, stop the per-profile tasks, `hermes gateway restart`). The dashboard's
System page offers the same migration as a button when the preflight finds an
eligible install.

## Updating the code

`hermes update` pulls the latest code once and syncs new bundled skills into
every profile:

```bash
hermes update
hermes-gateways restart
```

Running gateways are restarted by the update itself; on an install that still
runs one gateway per profile, the update then offers the
[migration to a single multiplexed gateway](#migrating-from-per-profile-gateways)
— automatically when nothing blocks it, otherwise as a warning with the fixes.

User-modified skills are never overwritten.

## Troubleshooting

### "Could not find service in domain for user gui: 501"

You ran `hermes gateway start` after a previous `hermes gateway stop`. The
CLI's `stop` does a full `launchctl unload`, which removes the service from
launchd's registry. The CLI catches this specific error on `start` and
automatically re-loads the plist (`↻ launchd job was unloaded; reloading
service definition`). The service starts normally. Nothing to fix.

### Stale PID after a crash

If a profile's gateway shows `not running` but a process is still alive:

```bash
ps -ef | grep "hermes_cli.*-p <profile>"
cat ~/.hermes/profiles/<profile>/gateway.pid
kill -TERM <pid>          # graceful
kill -KILL <pid>          # if that fails after a few seconds
<profile> gateway start
```

### Forcing a hard reset of one service

```bash
# macOS
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.hermes.gateway-<profile>.plist
launchctl load   ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.hermes.gateway-<profile>.plist

# Linux
systemctl --user restart hermes-gateway-<profile>.service
```

### Health check

```bash
hermes doctor                  # default profile
hermes -p <profile> doctor     # one profile
```
