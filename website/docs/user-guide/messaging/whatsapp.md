# WhatsApp Setup

Hermes connects to WhatsApp through a built-in bridge based on **Baileys**. This works by emulating a WhatsApp Web session — **not** through the official WhatsApp Business API. No Meta developer account or Business verification is required.

> Run `hermes gateway setup` and pick **WhatsApp** for a guided walk-through.

:::tip Two WhatsApp integrations
This page is for the **Baileys bridge** — quick to set up, personal accounts, no public URL needed, ban risk.

If you're running a real business bot and want stability, see the **[WhatsApp Business Cloud API guide](./whatsapp-cloud.md)** instead. It's the official Meta-supported path: no account ban risk, but requires a Meta Business account and a public webhook URL.

The two adapters can also run in parallel against different phone numbers if you have a reason to.
:::

:::warning Unofficial API — Ban Risk
WhatsApp does **not** officially support third-party bots outside the Business API. Using a third-party bridge carries a small risk of account restrictions. To minimize risk:
- **Use a dedicated phone number** for the bot (not your personal number)
- **Don't send bulk/spam messages** — keep usage conversational
- **Don't automate outbound messaging** to people who haven't messaged first
:::

:::warning WhatsApp Web Protocol Updates
WhatsApp periodically updates their Web protocol, which can temporarily break compatibility
with third-party bridges. When this happens, Hermes will update the bridge dependency. If the
bot stops working after a WhatsApp update, pull the latest Hermes version and re-pair.
:::

## Multiple profiles

The host multiplexer can serve a separate paired WhatsApp session for each profile.
Run `hermes -p work whatsapp` to pair a secondary profile, then enable WhatsApp
for that profile. An enabled profile without `creds.json` is skipped with the
`whatsapp_unpaired` status and its pairing command.

An explicit `platforms.whatsapp.extra.bridge_port` takes precedence. Otherwise,
a secondary selects the first free port in 3001 to 3999 that no other profile's
record claims, and saves it in its own `platforms/whatsapp/bridge_port` file for
subsequent starts. Operators can pre-create that file with a port number; delete
it to have a new port allocated. The launch profile uses port 3000 unless it
already has that file (from serving as a secondary), in which case its gateway
and `hermes send --to whatsapp:<chat_id>` both keep using the recorded port.

A secondary adopts a bridge already running on its port only when its own
session pidfile identifies that process (pid, kernel start time, and the port it
was started on), which is
what a gateway crash leaves behind. An unhealthy one is reaped by that same
identity and restarted. Any other process bound on the port is a fatal error
for that profile only. Set `platforms.whatsapp.extra.bridge_port` to a
distinct free port, or stop the process holding it. Other
profiles continue running. `hermes gateway status --profile work` reports the
profile's own WhatsApp adapter rather than shared ingress.

Profiles that each run their own gateway, rather than one multiplexed gateway,
all use port 3000 unless configured otherwise. Give each one a distinct port in
that profile's `config.yaml`:

```yaml
platforms:
  whatsapp:
    extra:
      bridge_port: 3001        # one distinct port per profile
```

A gateway identifies a running bridge by the session directory the bridge
reports in `/health`. A bridge serving another profile's session is never
adopted and never stopped: the second profile's WhatsApp fails to start with
`whatsapp_bridge_foreign_session`, naming the port and the other session. A
process that holds the port but does not answer `/health` in time is left
running too, and WhatsApp fails with the retryable
`whatsapp_bridge_unresponsive`. `hermes send --to whatsapp:<chat_id>` and cron
delivery check the same field and send nothing through another profile's bridge
or through one whose `/health` fails. If you
override `session_path`, keep it distinct per profile, or the profiles share one
WhatsApp login. Bridges started by an older Hermes report no session directory
and are restarted once, as after a bridge update.

## Two Modes

| Mode | How it works | Best for |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Separate bot number** (recommended) | Dedicate a phone number to the bot. People message that number directly. | Clean UX, multiple users, lower ban risk |
| **Personal self-chat** | Use your own WhatsApp. You message yourself to talk to the agent. | Quick setup, single user, testing |

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js v18+** and **npm** — the WhatsApp bridge runs as a Node.js process
- **A phone with WhatsApp** installed (for scanning the QR code)

Unlike older browser-driven bridges, the current Baileys-based bridge does **not** require a local Chromium or Puppeteer dependency stack.

---

## Step 1: Run the Setup Wizard

```bash
hermes whatsapp
```

The wizard will:

1. Ask which mode you want (**bot** or **self-chat**)
2. Install bridge dependencies if needed
3. Display a **QR code** in your terminal
4. Wait for you to scan it

**To scan the QR code:**

1. Open WhatsApp on your phone
2. Go to **Settings → Linked Devices**
3. Tap **Link a Device**
4. Point your camera at the terminal QR code

Once paired, the wizard confirms the connection and exits. Your session is saved automatically.

:::tip
If the QR code looks garbled, make sure your terminal is at least 60 columns wide and supports
Unicode. You can also try a different terminal emulator.
:::

## Step 2: Getting a Second Phone Number (Bot Mode)

For bot mode, you need a phone number that isn't already registered with WhatsApp. Three options:

| Option | Cost | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Google Voice** | Free | US only. Get a number at [voice.google.com](https://voice.google.com). Verify WhatsApp via SMS through the Google Voice app. |
| **Prepaid SIM** | $5–15 one-time | Any carrier. Activate, verify WhatsApp, then the SIM can sit in a drawer. Number must stay active (make a call every 90 days). |
| **VoIP services** | Free–$5/month | TextNow, TextFree, or similar. Some VoIP numbers are blocked by WhatsApp — try a few if the first doesn't work. |

After getting the number:

1. Install WhatsApp on a phone (or use WhatsApp Business app with dual-SIM)
2. Register the new number with WhatsApp
3. Run `hermes whatsapp` and scan the QR code from that WhatsApp account

---

## Step 3: Configure Hermes

Add the following to your `~/.hermes/.env` file:

```bash
# Required
WHATSAPP_ENABLED=true
WHATSAPP_MODE=bot                          # "bot" or "self-chat"

# Access control — pick ONE of these options:
WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_USERS=15551234567         # Comma-separated phone numbers (with country code, no +)
# WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_USERS=*                 # OR use * to allow everyone
# WHATSAPP_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true            # OR set this flag instead (same effect as *)
```

:::tip Allow-all shorthand
Setting `WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_USERS=*` allows **all** senders (equivalent to `WHATSAPP_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true`).
This is consistent with [Signal group allowlists](../../reference/environment-variables.md).
To use the pairing flow instead, remove both variables and rely on the
[DM pairing system](../security.md#dm-pairing-system).
:::

Optional behavior settings in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
unauthorized_dm_behavior: pair

whatsapp:
  unauthorized_dm_behavior: ignore
```

- `unauthorized_dm_behavior: pair` is the global default. Unknown DM senders get a pairing code.
- `whatsapp.unauthorized_dm_behavior: ignore` makes WhatsApp stay silent for unauthorized DMs, which is usually the better choice for a private number.

### Group chats (bot mode)

Groups are gated by **group policy**, not by the DM allowlist. `WHATSAPP_GROUP_POLICY` / `whatsapp.group_policy`
defaults to `pairing`, which forwards nothing from groups. `allowlist` plus `WHATSAPP_GROUP_ALLOWED_USERS` /
`whatsapp.group_allow_from` (comma-separated **group JIDs**, e.g. `120363001234567890@g.us`) admits the listed
groups; `open` admits every group the bot is a member of. The sender is then checked like any other gateway
principal: with `WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_USERS` set, a participant must be on it (or paired) — a sender WhatsApp
addresses by LID matches through the phone number Baileys supplies alongside it, so a first contact with no
`lid-mapping` file yet is not dropped; with no sender allowlist,
`allowlist` trusts the group-JID list alone and admits every participant of a listed group, while `open` still
needs the participant paired or `WHATSAPP_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true`. By default the bot answers every admitted group
message; set `require_mention: true` / `WHATSAPP_REQUIRE_MENTION=true` to answer only @mentions, replies to the
bot, or `/commands` (groups in `free_response_chats` are exempt).

Then start the gateway:

```bash
hermes gateway              # Foreground
hermes gateway install      # Install as a user service
sudo hermes gateway install --system   # Linux only: boot-time system service
```

The gateway starts the WhatsApp bridge automatically using the saved session.

---

## Session Persistence

The Baileys bridge saves its session under `~/.hermes/platforms/whatsapp/session`. This means:

- **Sessions survive restarts** — you don't need to re-scan the QR code every time
- The session data includes encryption keys and device credentials
- **Do not share or commit this session directory** — it grants full access to the WhatsApp account

---

## Re-pairing

If the session breaks (phone reset, WhatsApp update, manually unlinked), you'll see connection
errors in the gateway logs. To fix it:

```bash
hermes whatsapp
```

This generates a fresh QR code. Scan it again and the session is re-established. The gateway
handles **temporary** disconnections (network blips, phone going offline briefly) automatically
with reconnection logic.

---

## Voice Messages

Hermes supports voice on WhatsApp:

- **Incoming:** Voice messages (`.ogg` opus) are automatically transcribed using the configured STT provider: local `faster-whisper`, Groq Whisper (`GROQ_API_KEY`), or OpenAI Whisper (`VOICE_TOOLS_OPENAI_KEY`)
- **Outgoing:** TTS responses are sent as MP3 audio file attachments
- Agent responses are prefixed with "☤ **Hermes Agent**" by default. You can customize or disable this in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
whatsapp:
  reply_prefix: ""                          # Empty string disables the header
  # reply_prefix: "🤖 *My Bot*\n──────\n"  # Custom prefix (supports \n for newlines)
  send_read_receipts: false                 # Mark accepted inbound messages as read (blue ticks)
```

When `send_read_receipts` is `true`, the adapter marks policy-accepted inbound messages as read after DM/group/mention filtering passes. Rejected messages (e.g., from non-allowlisted senders) are not marked read. Disabled by default for privacy. Changing this setting automatically restarts the bridge subprocess on the next connection.

---

## Message Formatting & Delivery

WhatsApp supports **streaming (progressive) responses** — the bot edits its message in real-time as the AI generates text, just like Discord and Telegram. Internally, WhatsApp is classified as a TIER_MEDIUM platform for delivery capabilities.

### Chunking

Long responses are automatically split into multiple messages at **4,096 characters** per chunk (WhatsApp's practical display limit). You don't need to configure anything — the gateway handles splitting and sends chunks sequentially.

### WhatsApp-Compatible Markdown

Standard Markdown in AI responses is automatically converted to WhatsApp's native formatting:

| Markdown | WhatsApp | Renders as |
|----------|----------|------------|
| `**bold**` | `*bold*` | **bold** |
| `~~strikethrough~~` | `~strikethrough~` | ~~strikethrough~~ |
| `# Heading` | `*Heading*` | Bold text (no native headings) |
| `[link text](url)` | `link text (url)` | Inline URL |

Code blocks and inline code are preserved as-is since WhatsApp supports triple-backtick formatting natively.

### Tool Progress

When the agent calls tools (web search, file operations, etc.), WhatsApp displays real-time progress indicators showing which tool is running. This is enabled by default — no configuration needed.

### Native Polls, Clarify-as-Poll, and Locations

The Baileys-bridge adapter (bot mode) supports several native WhatsApp message types:

- **Polls** — the agent can send a native WhatsApp poll (question + options) via the bridge's `/send-poll` endpoint. Poll votes flow back into the conversation.
- **Clarify questions as polls** — when the agent asks a multiple-choice clarify question, it's rendered as a native single-select poll; tapping an option answers the question. If the poll fails to send, the adapter falls back to a plain text question. Approval prompts are **never** mapped onto polls — polls are only used for genuine multiple-choice clarifies.
- **Location pins** — the agent can send a native location pin (latitude/longitude, optional name/address) via `/send-location`, and incoming shared locations (including live locations) are delivered to the agent as location messages.

All of this works out of the box in bot (Baileys) mode; no configuration needed.

### Message Batching (Debounce)

WhatsApp delivers each message individually, so a rapid burst (forwarded batches, paste-splits, multi-line text) would otherwise trigger a separate agent invocation per fragment — wasting tokens and producing several disjointed replies. The adapter buffers successive text messages from the same chat and dispatches them as one combined request after a short quiet period (default **0.3s**, extended to **1s** for very long fragments; capped at 2s / 4s). Tune via `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
gateway:
  platforms:
    whatsapp:
      extra:
        text_batch_delay_seconds: 0.3         # quiet period before flushing a batch (max 2.0)
        text_batch_split_delay_seconds: 1.0   # extended delay near the split threshold (max 4.0)
```

Set `text_batch_delay_seconds: 0` to dispatch each message immediately (disables batching).

### Quoted Replies

Replying to (quoting) an earlier message gives the agent the quoted text as context. Quoting an image, voice note, video or document also attaches that file to the turn, so "what is this?" under a quoted image works — whether the attachment came from another person or from the bot itself (a cron-delivered chart, a generated image). WhatsApp only ships a thumbnail stub with a quote, so the file is resolved from the bridge's download cache (inbound media, in-memory for the bridge's lifetime) or from a local index of the bot's own sends (last 1000 messages); quotes of anything older arrive without the attachment.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **QR code not scanning** | Ensure terminal is wide enough (60+ columns). Try a different terminal. Make sure you're scanning from the correct WhatsApp account (bot number, not personal). |
| **QR code expires** | QR codes refresh every ~20 seconds. If it times out, restart `hermes whatsapp`. |
| **Session not persisting** | Check that `~/.hermes/platforms/whatsapp/session` exists and is writable. If containerized, mount it as a persistent volume. |
| **Logged out unexpectedly** | WhatsApp unlinks devices after long inactivity. Keep the phone on and connected to the network, then re-pair with `hermes whatsapp` if needed. |
| **Bridge crashes or reconnect loops** | Restart the gateway, update Hermes, and re-pair if the session was invalidated by a WhatsApp protocol change. |
| **Bot stops working after WhatsApp update** | Update Hermes to get the latest bridge version, then re-pair. |
| **macOS: "Node.js not installed" but node works in terminal** | launchd services don't inherit your shell PATH. Run `hermes gateway install` to re-snapshot your current PATH into the plist, then `hermes gateway start`. See the [Gateway Service docs](./index.md#macos-launchd) for details. |
| **Messages not being received** | Verify `WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_USERS` includes the sender's number (with country code, no `+` or spaces), or set it to `*` to allow everyone. Set `WHATSAPP_DEBUG=true` in `.env` and restart the gateway to see raw message events in `bridge.log`. |
| **Bot replies to strangers with a pairing code** | Set `whatsapp.unauthorized_dm_behavior: ignore` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml` if you want unauthorized DMs to be silently ignored instead. |

---

## Security

:::warning
**Configure access control** before going live. Set `WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_USERS` with specific
phone numbers (including country code, without the `+`), use `*` to allow everyone, or set
`WHATSAPP_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true`. Without any of these, the gateway **denies all incoming
messages** as a safety measure.
:::

By default, unauthorized DMs still receive a pairing code reply. If you want a private WhatsApp number to stay completely silent to strangers, set:

```yaml
whatsapp:
  unauthorized_dm_behavior: ignore
```

- The `~/.hermes/platforms/whatsapp/session` directory contains full session credentials — protect it like a password
- Set file permissions: `chmod 700 ~/.hermes/platforms/whatsapp/session`
- Use a **dedicated phone number** for the bot to isolate risk from your personal account
- If you suspect compromise, unlink the device from WhatsApp → Settings → Linked Devices
- Phone numbers in logs are partially redacted, but review your log retention policy
